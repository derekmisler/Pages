<p class="intro">Asheville's top chefs have traveled the world to learn their craft, but they all know a secret- the best ingredients are found right here at home. Many of the city's best restaurants have paired with local farmers to bring the freshest fruits and vegetables directly from the farm to the table.</p>
<p>Top chefs visit <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/tailgate-markets/">local tailgate markets</a> and farms several times each week to make sure their customers are served fresh mountain-grown produce. <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/food-adventures/u-pick-farms/">Local farmers</a> are also raising free-range, hormone-free beef, pork and lamb and bringing back heirloom fruits and vegetables. There's nothing like biting into a tomato bred for flavor instead of one engineered to survive a cross-country trip.</p>
