					<em class="img-right txt-right legal"><img class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/grove-arcade-exterior.jpg" />Grove Arcade</em>
					<p>Start the day right with a made-from-scratch meal. Downtown is home to a wide array of places that serve up breakfast. Two eateries are legendary in their own rights: Early Girl and Over Easy. Between the two of them, they&rsquo;ve been serving up breakfast in downtown Asheville for over 45 years. Or, tap into your inner Anglophile while you sip some coffee and people-watch on a (stationary) British double-decker bus at Double D&rsquo;s Coffee &amp; Desserts.</p>
					<p>Browse the various <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/discover-downtown/shops-galleries/">galleries and eclectic shops</a> downtown has to offer. Locals frequent <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2013/06/lexington-avenue-shopping.html" target="_blank">Lexington Avenue</a> when looking for funky finds and vintage clothing.</p>
					<p>Need a breather? Tucked away in one of Asheville&rsquo;s architectural highlights, the <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2013/06/great-shopping-at-grove-arcade.html" target="_blank">Grove Arcade</a>, is the Wake Foot Sanctuary &amp; Spa where you can treat your feet to a relaxing soak and massage. Or just take a load on a comfy couch at the pet-friendly and charmingly unique Battery Park Book Exchange &amp; Champagne Bar, a used bookstore and champagne/wine bar.</p>
					<p>Off the beaten path, the Asheville Salt Cave is where the locals go to unwind. Even though it&rsquo;s located just a block from Pack Square, few tourists ever discover it. It&rsquo;s a one-of-a-kind place for relaxation, rehabilitation, and balance and is truly an Asheville experience.</p>

					<h4>Midday</h4>
					<p>Time for lunch. If you know where to look you can dine in a delightful &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; courtyard. Enjoy French comfort food from either Bouchon or Bouchon Creperi&rsquo;s European style courtyards or dine on Louisiana-inspired fare in Mayfel&rsquo;s New Orleans-style outdoor setting. These are just a few of the many restaurants that offer outdoor patio dining in Asheville. Search for <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/restaurants/by-cuisine/al-fresco-dining-sidewalk-cafes/">Al Fresco Dining &amp; Sidewalk Cafes</a> here.</p>
					<p>Indulge your sweet tooth in the late afternoon with a self-guided tour of a chocolate factory and see the entire bean-to-bar process at your own pace.</p>

					<em class="img-right txt-right legal"><img class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/hover-boxes/jack-of-the-wood-downtown-asheville.jpg" width="250" />Jack of the Wood</em>
					<h4>Evening</h4>
					<p>No matter how long they&rsquo;ve lived in Asheville, locals agree that watching the <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2013/11/top-5-sunset-spots-in-asheville.html" target="_blank">sun sink behind the mountains</a> from the Omni Grove Park Inn&rsquo;s Sunset Terrace never gets old. Get there early to snag a table.</p>
					<p>After the sun goes down catch some <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/music-scene/">live music</a> at Jack of the Wood (&ldquo;Old Time Mountain Music&rdquo; on Wednesdays and bluegrass jam on Thursdays) or The Lobster Trap any night.</p>
					<p>Options for dinner are numerous and you&rsquo;ll find a <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/restaurants/">downtown restaurant</a> for most any cuisine. If you&rsquo;re in town on a Sunday, don&rsquo;t miss &ldquo;Sunday Supper&rdquo; at James-Beard nominated John Fleer&rsquo;s Rhubarb restaurant, right on Pack Square in the heart of the city. A local guest farmer plays host during a three-course meal served family-style.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="West-Asheville-RAD" class="hide">
					<h2>West Asheville/River Arts District</h2>
					<h4>Morning</h4>
					<p>Hip and happening, West Asheville has a funky vibe all its own. Fuel up for the day ahead at Sunny Point Caf&eacute; (try the much-celebrated huevos rancheros!) or a short hop down the road will take you to Biscuit Head and their take on a Southern staple&mdash;biscuits as &ldquo;big as a cat&rsquo;s head&rdquo; served up with a mouth-watering selection of homemade gravies and fixings.</p>
					<p>Continue your trek down Haywood Road, the main drag of this <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2013/12/whats-hot-out-west.html" target="_blank">retro meets cool, laid-back neighborhood</a>, for its many shops, vintage boutiques and consignment stores. Harvest Records is a regular haunt for area music lovers.</p>

					<h4>Midday</h4>
					<em class="img-right txt-right legal"><img class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/hover-boxes/north-carolina-ribs-at-12-bones.jpg" width="250" />Ribs from 12 Bones Smokehouse</em>
					<p>Enjoy outdoor dining at Universal Joint or Nona Mia, or make your way to the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/River-Arts-District/218/default/">River Arts District</a> for a bite at Clingman Caf&eacute; where you can watch the trains roll by or at White Duck Taco Shop, complete with a pet-friendly courtyard. In the mood for barbecue? Those that keep up with the President&rsquo;s travels know that 12 Bones Smokehouse is a favorite Asheville lunchtime spot of Obama. Make plans to visit during the week as they&rsquo;re closed on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
					<p>If you&rsquo;re in the area on a Tuesday, the West Asheville Tailgate Market kicks off at 3:30. Area residents walk or bike to the market, drawn by the abundant array of local foods, crafts, herbal products, and the tempting hot prepared meals to go. We love our fresh produce here (and baked goods and jams and jellies, and&hellip;) so we support over 17 local <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/tailgate-and-farmers-markets/">tailgate markets</a>&mdash;you can find one most every day of the week.</p>
					<p>Get into the creative vibe with a behind-the-scenes look at the many working artist studios and galleries that line the French Broad River in revitalized old warehouses. From painters to potters to woodworkers, nearly every medium is represented for your up-close-and-personal viewing pleasure.</p>
					<p>Feeling inspired to make some art of your own? Professional glassblowers at Asheville Glass Center will guide you through the process of creating a cup, ornament or paperweight for keeps!</p>

					<h4>Evening</h4>
					<em class="img-right txt-right legal"><img class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/asheville-cvb-wedge-brewery-2.jpg" width="" />Wedge Brewing Co.</em>
					<p>After a day of feasting your eyes, try dinner at the Bull &amp; Beggar (they have a &ldquo;Raw Bar Happy Hour&rdquo; nightly until 6 p.m.) or All Souls Pizza, where they mill their own flour from organic grains. On Tuesdays, All Souls offers up free live music starting at 7:00 and knocks half the price off their bottles of wine. You can search for other close by restaurants by cuisine <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/restaurants/by-cuisine/">here</a>.</p>
					<p>For a truly local experience you&rsquo;ll find plenty of Ashevilleans quenching their thirst with a craft beer at Wedge Brewing Co. and on Tuesdays and Thursdays, dining from El Kimchi, the popular food truck that serves up a fusion of Korean/Mexican street food.</p>
					<p>Just up the street The Isis Restaurant &amp; Music Hall draws people from all over the Asheville area with its Tuesday Bluegrass Sessions. The sessions are hosted each week by a local bluegrass musician. It doesn&rsquo;t get more local than this. The show is free and starts at 7:30.</p>
					<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/music-scene/">music venues</a> in Asheville. As we like to say, from bluegrass to newgrass so nograss, you can find it here.</p>

				<div id="South-of-Downtown" class="hide">
					<h2>South of Downtown</h2>
					<h4>Morning</h4>
					<em class="img-right txt-right legal"><img class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/biltmore-village-170x252.jpg" width="" />Historic Biltmore Village</em>
					<p>Begin your step into Asheville&rsquo;s past by visiting historic Biltmore Village, the century-old planned community of cottages and shops for workers at the Biltmore Estate. It&rsquo;s now home to one-of-a-kind <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/shopping/?listsearch_submit=1&subcatID=0&regionID=8&listing_keyword=keyword+%28optional%29&submit=Search#searchBr">shopping</a> and <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/restaurants/by-neighborhood/biltmore-village/">restaurants</a>. Enjoy breakfast at popular Corner Kitchen, a renovated Victorian home, or for a quicker bite to eat, order up some decadent pastries at Well-Bred Bakery &amp; Caf&eacute;, located just across the street.</p>
					<p>Properly fortified, stroll through <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2014/02/6-things-you-didnt-know-about-biltmore.html" target="_blank">Historic Biltmore Village</a> just outside the gates of America&rsquo;s largest home, and pop into the many shops and galleries while taking in the picturesque English Manor aesthetic throughout. </p>

					<h4>Midday</h4>
					<em class="img-right txt-right legal"><img class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/biltmore-square.jpg" width="" />The Biltmore</em>
					<p>Plan at least half a day for the grandeur of Biltmore Estate in order to tour the house and elaborate gardens. Many hiking and biking enthusiasts in the area have an annual pass that they use to explore the far corners of the vast 8,000-acre estate that include a lake with two islands. To truly appreciate George Vanderbilt&rsquo;s and Frederick Olmsted&rsquo;s broad visions, upgrade your ticket for a second day to walk or bike through the park-like grounds.</p>

					<h4>Evening</h4>
					<p>Cap off your journey through time with dinner at one of five restaurants on the estate. Pick up a bottle of Biltmore&rsquo;s best at the winery and enjoy it on the Antler Hill Village Green or in one of the various themed gardens. Insider tip: A picnic by the lagoon affords a great view of Biltmore, from a perspective that is often missed by time-crunched day-trippers.</p>


				</div>
				<div id="Further-Out" class="hide">
					<h2>Further Out</h2>
					<h4>Morning</h4>
					<em class="img-right txt-right legal"><img class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/hover-boxes/blue-ridge-parkway-in-the-summer.jpg" width="250" />Blue Ridge Parkway</em>
					<p>Grab some groceries on the go at a perennial local favorite, Greenlife Grocery, located one block north of downtown, to stock up on some snack and picnic provisions for later. You&rsquo;ll notice a number of locals taking advantage of the vast offerings of prepared foods.</p>
					<p>Head for the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/blue-ridge-parkway/" target="_blank">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>, this most scenic of drives, and be sure to <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2013/06/miles-of-beauty.html" target="_blank">take your time</a> on the iconic roadway&rsquo;s winding curves to fully appreciate its magnificence. On occasion you&rsquo;ll notice a group of cars parked along the side of the road. Avid Asheville hikers know where the more secluded trail heads are so feel free to follow their lead and stop for an impromptu hike. </p>

					<h4>Midday</h4>
					<em class="img-right txt-right legal"><img class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/hover-boxes/arboretum-house.jpg" width="250" />North Carolina Arboretum</em>
					<p>Craggy Gardens is the perfect place for your picnic, followed by a post-meal hike of the 1.5-mile roundtrip Craggy Pinnacle Trail (at Milepost 367).</p>
					<p>Trade some natural beauty for a dose of the manmade variety at the <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2013/06/where-to-find-best-folk-art-in-asheville.html" target="_blank">Folk Art Center</a> (Milepost 382), home to some of the finest in traditional and contemporary crafts throughout the Southern Appalachians.</p>
					<p>Carry on &mdash; but remember, no rushing! You can hop off the parkway at milepost 393 and visit the 434-acre <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2013/06/65-acres-of-cultivated-gardens.html" target="_blank">North Carolina Arboretum</a> where cultivated gardens, changing exhibits, tours, nature activities and forested hiking and biking trails will vie for your attention. Or, if you feel the lure of the river, opt for tubing on the near-by French Broad.</p>

					<h4>Evening</h4>
					<p>After a day of hiking or fun on the French Broad many locals like to hit one of Asheville&rsquo;s many <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/beer-scene/">breweries and pubs</a>. Fortunately since we have the most breweries per capita in the US, you&rsquo;re never far one. Since opening downtown in 2008, Thirsty Monk&rsquo;s beers have become so popular that they now have a couple of neighborhood pubs and if you&rsquo;re near the Arboretum, there&rsquo;s one just down the road. </p>


				</div>
				<div id="Surrounding-Towns" class="hide">
					<h2>Surrounding Towns</h2>
					<h4>Morning</h4>
					<em class="img-right txt-right legal"><img class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/hover-boxes/black-mountain-street.jpg" width="250" />Black Mountain</em>
					<p>Head about 15 minutes east of downtown to experience the genuine southern hospitality of the town of <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/neighborhoods-nearby-towns/black-mountain/">Black Mountain</a>, which locals fondly refer to as the &ldquo;front porch&rdquo; of the Western North Carolina mountains. First stop: breakfast at the Red Rocker Inn, a restored Victorian house, for something savory or sweet (red velvet pancakes or caramel-pecan French toast anyone?). To ensure you get a seat, it&rsquo;s advisable to make breakfast reservations in advance.</p>
					<p>Walk through this charming town&rsquo;s many artsy <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/neighborhoods-nearby-towns/black-mountain/">shops and boutiques</a>. &ldquo;Old timey&rdquo; Town Hardware occupies three historic buildings from the 1920&rsquo;s and is just plain fun to poke around in. </p>

					<h4>Midday</h4>
					<em class="img-right txt-right legal"><img class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/happy-goat1.jpg" width="250" />Goat at Looking Glass Creamery</em>
					<p>For a one-stop shop you can pick up some souvenirs for those back home and some southern fare for yourself at Veranda Caf&eacute;&eacute; and Gifts or saunter down the quaint streets and pick from a variety of <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/restaurants/by-neighborhood/black-mountain/">cafes and restaurants</a>.</p>
					<p>If you&rsquo;re yearning for a leisurely drive and some fresh mountain air, head to Hickory Nut Gap Farm in Fairview, just south of downtown Asheville. Offering seasonal activities such as tours, hay rides and berry picking (black raspberries and blueberries in June), this working farm also has a store on-site selling its grass-fed beef, pastured pork and poultry products.</p>
					<p>Just a few minutes away is <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/09/where-to-find-big-cheese.html" target="_blank">Looking Glass Creamery</a>, a small family farm with a licensed cheese making facility and just one of the stops on the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/food-adventures/wnc-cheese-trail/">WNC Cheese Trail</a>. Looking Glass&rsquo;s cheese shop is open from 3&ndash;7pm on Thursdays. Don&rsquo;t miss tasting Ellington, their award-winning, signature goat milk cheese.</p>

					<h4>Evening</h4>
					<p>If you choose to extend your time in Black Mountain, sample some house-made and organic microbrews at Pisgah Brewing Company. Pisgah Brewing has an outdoor stage and regular live music. Round out your evening with a show at White Horse Black Mountain, a venue that hosts various performing arts.</p>
