Nestled in a verdant Blue Ridge Mountain valley and framed by the highest peaks along the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventures/blue-ridge-parkway/">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>, Asheville, NC has become the craft-brewing center of the Southeast. Asheville beer has garnered so much enthusiasm that it was named the winner of Examiner's &quot;Beer City, USA&quot; poll for four years.
</p>
<p>
Boasting more breweries per capita than any U.S. city, the Asheville area is home to 23 craft breweries. On any given day, roughly 100 local beers can be enjoyed in Asheville, served on draft and in bottles. The scene has reached a fever pitch with five annual beer festivals, brewery tours and unusual products made from beer like shampoo, ice cream and mustard.
</p>
<p>
With 15 active farmers' markets, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/">250+ independent restaurants</a>, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/beer-breweries/">23 fantastic craft breweries</a>, America's most visited winery and hundreds of inspired local products&mdash;all within a city of 85,000&mdash;Asheville is a thriving community of culinary creatives. The city gleefully blurs the lines between art, food and mountain culture, pushing the boundaries of the plate and charting new territory in craft beer, cocktails and wine. Local sake or hard cider anyone? <i>Grab a chair and join us&hellip;</i>

<h3>Legendary Conference Locale: Biltmore</h3>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/"><img alt="The Biltmore in Asheville, North Carolina" class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/biltmore-square.jpg" style="width: 100%" /></a>
<p>
Conference programming will take place on the grounds of America's largest private home&mdash;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/">Biltmore</a>. The 250-room mansion, built by George W. Vanderbilt in 1895 and beautifully preserved and restored for visitors today, is only one part of the Biltmore experience, which also includes numerous gardens, trails and outdoor adventures on the 8,000-acre estate, shopping and dining at Antler Hill Village, and welcoming hospitality at the Inn on Biltmore Estate. Add to that a legacy of sustainable agricultural practices, America's most visited (and award-winning) winery, and the majestic vistas of the surrounding Blue Ridge Mountains, and it's easy to see why more than one million travelers choose to visit Biltmore each year.
