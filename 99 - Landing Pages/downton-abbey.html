<p>
This season in Asheville, North Carolina, America's Largest Home takes on one of television's biggest dramas. Beginning February 5, Biltmore welcomes 47 original costumes from the hit PBS series <i>Downton Abbey</i> as a part of the exhibit <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/events/index.cfm?action=displayDetail&amp;eventid=5456&amp;parentID=1">&quot;Dressing Downton: Changing Fashion for Changing Times.&quot;</a>
</p>
<p>
The exhibit of award-winning costumes-all of which were actually worn on the set of the show-juxtapose Downton's fictional Crawley family and household with the real life stories of the Vanderbilts, highlighting the striking resemblance between Biltmore and the way of life at Highclere Castle around the turn of twentieth century.
</p>
<p>
The display explores themes such as the evolution of fashion, nuances of etiquette, the changing roles of women and the life of service staff. New stories about George and Edith Vanderbilt, their daughter Cornelia, their often illustrious guests and their domestic servants will be shared in Biltmore's free printed guide and in the Biltmore House audio guide ($10 in addition to estate admission.)
</p>

The price of this specialty tour is $17 in addition to estate admission and requires advance reservations.
