<p>
With warmer temperatures creeping into the forecast you can bet there are some really hot days in store for all of us this summer.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, you can escape to the mountains of Asheville, N.C., to find relief from those oppressive heat waves. Even better, you can leave your wallet at home because these refreshing adventures won't break the bank.
</p>
<h3>
Splasheville</h3>
<p>
<b></b>Asheville's interactive water fountain is located in downtown Asheville in <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Pack-Square-Park/35/default/">Pack Square Park</a>. With arching sprays of water that fly up randomly, this is a perfect way to get soaked and cool off. Let the summer sun dry you off while relaxing on the rolling green field that the park provides. The fountain generally runs daily from 9 a.m. through 9 p.m. from April through November.
</p>
<h3>
Sliding Rock</h3>
<p>
Take water sliding to a whole new level. <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventures/water-adventures/?tab=sliding-rock#sliding-rock">This 60-foot all-natural water slide</a> has been providing entertainment long before water slides were standard fare. There is a $2 per person fee to help maintain the area so be prepared for this nominal cost. Lifeguards are on duty 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., from Memorial Day through Labor Day.
</p>
<h3>French Broad River</h3>
<p>
Asheville's own river is not only one of the oldest in the world, it is also one of the most versatile when it comes to go-with-the-flow adventures. Ride the river in a <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventures/water-adventures/#whitewater-rafting">whitewater raft</a>, on a stand-up paddleboard, in a tube, on a Bellyak (a kayak you ride on your belly) or in a canoe. <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventures/water-adventures/#listings">Area outfitters</a> can prepare floaters for any sort of trip, and don't forget to take a float break for a pint of craft beer at <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/The-Bywater/3861/default/">The Bywater</a> bar, right on the banks of the French Broad.

<h3>Mount Mitchell</h3>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/hiking-trails/mount-mitchell/">tallest peak east of the Mississippi River</a> offers both an oasis from the summer heat and stunning 360-degree views from the summit's observation deck. Drive or hike to the top of <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Mount-Mitchell-State-Park/294/default/">Mount Mitchell State Park</a>, and be sure to pack a sweater--the weather can be surprisingly chilly compared to what you may experience in town or along the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventures/blue-ridge-parkway/">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>.

<h3>
Secret Swimming Holes</h3>
<p>
<b></b>Shhhh... Don't tell anyone we told you about these. Check out these <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventures/water-adventures/#swimming-holes">great swimming holes</a> around the Asheville area.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Looking Glass Falls:</b> Just down the road from Sliding Rock, off U.S. 276 heading south off the Blue Ridge Parkway, the base of this 80-foot falls is popular for cooling off and wading. Caution should always be exercised around the falls.</li>
	<li><b>Graveyard Fields:</b> A short hike through native rhododendron takes visitors to the lower falls where large slabs of rock become choice spots for sunbathing or picnicking. A short distant further, the Yellowstone Prong of the Pigeon River becomes shallow, slow and lazy, dotted with small gravel islands that make it a cooling off spot for even the youngest family members. Parking is located at mile marker 418 on the Blue Ridge Parkway, about 40 minutes from Asheville.</li>
	<li><b>Carolina Hemlock Campground:</b> Along the South Toe River you'll find a campground where adults and children can cool off in the chilly water that comes off Mt. Mitchell. Large slabs of rock are ideal for sunbathing or jumping, as the deepest part drops to 14 feet. The river runs along NC 80 North off of the Blue Ridge Parkway.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sweet Treats</h3>
<p>
Take a break from exploring downtown and seek out a frozen snack. Local hotspots like <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/The-Hop-Ice-Cream-Cafe/3866/default/">The Hop</a>, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Ultimate-Ice-Cream/382/default/">Ultimate Ice Cream</a> and French Broad Chocolate Lounge are known for their quirky and locally inspired flavors.
