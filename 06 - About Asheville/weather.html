<h3>What to Expect in Winter in Asheville</h3>

<p>Asheville is blessed with a unique winter weather combination: nearby ski resorts get most of the snow, while downtown remains sheltered from the worst winter temperatures. Asheville native Thomas Wolfe compared being in Asheville to sitting inside the rim of a cup - and that unique feature often protects the city from inclement weather in nearby mountains. While Mt. Pisgah, just 25 miles away, may be inundated by snow, Asheville may only get a rain shower, since the temperature and elevation difference is enough to keep the city above freezing.</p>
<p>Snowfalls in Asheville are usually fleeting, but spectacular. On average, Asheville gets 4.6, 4.4, and 3.0 inches of snow per month during January, February and March. That's a little more than Charlotte's 2.0 inches in January, but nowhere near the 8.6 inches in New York City's Central Park in February, or even the 7.1 inches at Washington, DC's Dulles Airport each January. Snowfall is greater in the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains, home to several <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/seasonal-fun/winter/sports/">ski slopes and snowtubing parks</a>.</p>
