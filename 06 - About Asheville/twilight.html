<p class="intro">When Mitchell Lonas&rsquo; mother gave him a bird&rsquo;s nest made of horsehair he had an epiphany for what he wanted to create, but never did he imagine that his inspiration would eventually lead to placement in a major motion picture.</p>
<p><img align="right" alt="" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/Images/emails/October2011/Lonas.jpg" />An emerging artist out of Asheville, Mitchell&rsquo;s work has been featured in art galleries around the southeast. It was his striking metal nest pieces on display at the Gallery Bienvenu in New Orleans that caught the eye of the set designer for the Twilight films.</p>
<p>On the day of Mitchell&rsquo;s 40th birthday the gallery owner called with the big news and Mitchell went to work crafting the pieces that serve as a primary accent in the upcoming film Breaking Dawn (which hits theatres on November 18).</p>
<h3>Here&rsquo;s a peak of the trailer.</h3>
