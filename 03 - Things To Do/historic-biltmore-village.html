			<p>In 1888, George W. Vanderbilt arrived in Asheville, purchased some land, and began planning the estate that would be his home&#8212;<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/">Biltmore</a>. As construction of America's Largest Home came to a close, and as the estate hired hundreds of domestic servants, gardeners and other workers, the architects and designers hired by Mr. Vanderbilt turned their sights toward the village that would serve as an entryway to the estate and would support the new workforce.</p>
			<p>As the nineteenth century made way for the twentieth, the village saw many changes, including the opening of All Souls Church, the introduction of one of the nation's first electric street railways, the opening of a school attended by estate workers' children and the Vanderbilts' own daughter, Cornelia, and the completion of several cottages and a post office. In 1910, builders completed a shopping center that offered all of the basic needs, including a grocery store and produce market, hardware store, caf&eacute; and drug store.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Historic-Biltmore-Village/255/default/">Biltmore Village</a> owes its iconic architecture and picturesque, tree-lined streets to some of Biltmore's most noted experts. Richard Morris Hunt—lead architect on the Biltmore project—and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmstead&#8212;of Central Park fame&#8212;both left their marks on the village. However, it's Richard Sharpe Smith, who took over after Hunt's death in 1895, who is often credited with the area's design, featuring brick, pebbledash stucco and prominent wood timbers.</p>
			<p>Beginning this spring, visitors can encounter the history of Biltmore Village first-hand with a walking tour offered by <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/History-Hand/162/default/">History@Hand</a>.</p>

			<h3>Mark your calendars for two annual events that showcase the history and spirit of Biltmore Village:</h3>
			<p>Help on the first full weekend of August, the annual Village Art &amp; Craft Fair has been bringing high-quality handmade crafts to Biltmore Village for more than 40 years. Begun by entrepreneur and gallery owner John Cram in 1972, the festival regularly brings more than 100 artists from across the U.S. to the grounds of the Cathedral of All Souls. Visitors can meet artists in person as they discover new treasures.</p>
			<p>During the holiday season, Biltmore Village plays host to the Dickens Festival, which features musicians, choral groups, dancers and actors stationed throughout the village in Victorian dress. Village buildings are decorated with more than 250,000 Christmas lights, and shops stay open late to welcome visitors. Look for this merry holiday festival&#8212;which has run for more than 25 years&#8212;during the first weekend in December.</p>
