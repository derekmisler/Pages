Indulge in an aromatherapy massage while gazing at the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains. Get away from it all in a secluded log cabin, where you can relax in your personal spa tub filled with warm mineral spring waters and boasting a view of the stars above. Your entire body can be scrubbed in luscious organic brown sugar and vanilla, or wrapped in divine mountain honey and warm goatbutter cream. In fact, start the relaxation now with the simplicity of booking a <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/packages-deals/packages/spa/">spa vacation package</a>.

The Asheville area's reputation as a destination for spa treatments and wellness dates back centuries. One of the East Coast's only natural hot spring water sources, in Hot Springs, has been attracting visitors since its discovery in the 1700s. Its mineral waters are still known for treating a variety of ailments, including anemia, nerve conditions, heart problems and digestive issues.

<p>
Today, the Asheville area has evolved into a premier spa destination. The region features a diverse mix of treatments and wellness services virtually unheard-of outside major metropolitan areas.

<p>
Asheville's devotion to wellness does not end with massages and facials. There are <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/spas-wellness/yoga-classes-retreats/">yoga studios</a> in Asheville, as well as classes in tai chi and pilates, and couples weekends learning Argentine tango. Be it a simple weekend of relaxation, a romantic couple's getaway in the mountains or a chance to improve your health, Asheville is the ultimate destination for those seeking spas and wellness.
