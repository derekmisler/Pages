<h2>The Beginning of the Blue Ridge Parkway</h2>

<p>The seed was planted for a scenic road through the Blue Ridge Mountains when North Carolina geologist Joseph Hyde Pratt proposed a mountain toll roll stretching from Marion, VA, to Tallulah, GA. World War I halted work on the road, but the idea of a scenic road persisted.</p>

<p>The construction of the Skyline Drive through Shenandoah National Park turned into a serendipitous event when President Franklin Roosevelt visited the construction site in 1933. Senator Harry Flood Byrd recommended that the roadway extend to the newly created Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Roosevelt thoroughly endorsed this idea, and plans on began on a new public works project: the &quot;Park-to-Park Highway.&quot;</p>

<h2>Parkway Construction Begins</h2>

<p>Work on the Blue Ridge Parkway began on September 11, 1935, near Cumberland Knob, NC. The majority of the work was completed by private contractors under federal contracts, but other agencies assisted. New Deal public works agencies, Works Progress Administration personnel, crews from the Emergency Relief Administration, Civilian Conservation Corps camps and Civilian Public Service workers cleared brush, drilled rock and did other manual labor tasks. The project offered the chance to earn a paycheck in difficult times-a wonderful opportunity for many mountain residents.</p>

<p>World War II caused construction on the Parkway to halt. In the 1950s, the creation of Mission 66, a National Park Service development program, renewed interest in completing the Parkway. The majority of the Parkway was completed by 1966, except for a small portion near Grandfather Mountain, NC. In 1987, the Linn Cove Viaduct was created so the Parkway could pass by Grandfather Mountain without damaging the rugged terrain. Once the viaduct was installed, the Shenandoah National Park and Great Smoky Mountains National Park were forever linked.</p>
