<h3>2014 Fall Color Forecast: Experts See Red</h3>
<img src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/red-leaves-in-fall.jpg" alt="Red Leaves in Fall Sunset" border="0" width="400" height="267" align="right" class="imgshadow img-right" />

According to Dr. Howard S. Neufeld, professor of biology and &quot;fall color guy&quot; at Appalachian State University, red is often the color perceived as the one that makes for a spectacular fall season. And according to Neufeld and other experts, fans of the crimson hue may be in luck.
</p>
<p>
<b>&quot;Cool, clear sunny days bring on lots of photosynthesis and this makes for brilliant red colors,&quot;</b> said Neufeld.  &quot;The beginning of the fall season will be punctuated with varying shades of red from maples, sourwoods, dogwoods, black gums and burning bush.  The last splash of color will come later with scarlet and red oaks.  Red really stands out, even against an already-beautiful fall landscape.&quot;

The weather over the next few weeks plays the most important role in fall's color intensity with cool nights and sunny days being the recipe for a bold season.

</p>
<p>
&quot;For the summer as a whole, Asheville was slightly cooler than average and near average for precipitation,&quot; said Jake Crouch, climate scientist at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center in Asheville. &quot;The precipitation is nothing compared to last summer when Asheville had its wettest summer on record. That makes me think we can expect a more vibrant autumn this year.&quot;&nbsp;
