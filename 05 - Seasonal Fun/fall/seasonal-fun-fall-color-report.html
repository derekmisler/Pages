<p>Discover for yourself why Asheville is one of America's favorite places for fall color hunting. The Blue Ridge Mountains experience one of the longest fall color seasons in the world, which means visitors often have the opportunity to catch peak color beginning in late September and extending into early November. Be sure to <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/hotels/">book a room</a> in advance to catch the big show.</p>

<h2>Fall Color Hunting</h2>
<h3>Cool Temps Trigger Color in Higher Elevations</h3>
<p>

<i class="img-right"></i>It's time for cozy sweaters and pumpkin spice lattes! The first cold snap of fall passed through Asheville this past week, accelerating the transition of leaves to their autumn hues. Anyone wanting to leaf-look this week should have no problem finding vibrant swaths of fall color in key areas around the mountains.
</p>
<p>
Higher elevations are still your best bet for finding fall foliage this week. <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventures/blue-ridge-parkway/">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>&nbsp;officials report areas south of Asheville, like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/hiking-trails/devils-courthouse/">Devil's Courthouse</a> and <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/hiking-trails/graveyard-fields-trail/">Graveyard Fields</a> (elevation 4,960 feet), are seeing about 60-70% color change. Areas below 3,500 feet are still patchy, with only 10-30% of trees in transition.
</p>
<p>

North of Asheville, eyewitnesses say the best color is in the mid-elevation range (3,500 feet to 4,500 feet), which includes the slopes of <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Grandfather-Mountain/179/default/">Grandfather Mountain</a>&nbsp;and around Linville. To the west of Asheville, color is looking best in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventures/great-smoky-mountains/">Great Smoky Mountains</a>&nbsp;along Clingmans Dome road. This scenic fall drive leads to a 6,644-foot summit and an incredible 360-degree view.
</p>
<p>
While trees are currently experiencing peak to near-peak conditions in the higher elevations, those traveling later in the month shouldn't worry about missing the big show. Asheville has one of the longest peak seasons in the world thanks to large variations in both elevation and tree species.

<h3>Trees in Transition</h3>
<p>
Clara Curtis from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/North-Carolina-Arboretum/26/default/">North Carolina Arboretum</a>&nbsp;reports a number of tree species currently changing color. Among these are the ash, poplar, buckeye, sugar maple and a variety of native and ornamental grasses. Trees in this area remain in the early stages, but should start to pop with full color over the next few weeks.

Village</a>. Photo courtesy of Biltmore.</i>Fall Color Guy, Howard Neufeld, reports that &quot;at the highest elevations, mountain ash have dropped their leaves, the beeches (yellow) are peaking and in the understory the viburnums are at their peak orange/yellow color.&quot; This would include areas like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/hiking-trails/craggy-gardens/">Craggy Gardens</a>, up toward&nbsp;<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/hiking-trails/mount-mitchell/">Mount Mitchell</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/">Biltmore's</a>&nbsp;horticulture expert, Parker Andes, says, the &quot;cool weather has helped brighten the color on the fruit of beauty berry, hollies, viburnums and other ornamental shrubs.  Ornamental grasses are at their peak.  Look for pink muhly grass and Japanese maiden grass flower stalks backlit in the sun.  Our gardeners have packed the annual beds with chrysanthemums, fall blooming salvias and other foliage plants.&quot;
</p>
<h3>Where the Wild Things Are</h3>
<p>
October is a perfect time, if not the year's last hurrah, for spotting wildlife. Right now, hundreds of hawks are beginning their annual migration to a warmer climate. Since these birds of prey typically stick to the rocky outcroppings of higher elevations, you'll want to visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/hiking-trails/waterrock-knob/">Waterrock Knob</a>&nbsp;(elevation 6,292) to catch the show. Be on the lookout for Sharp-Shinned Hawks, Red-Tailed Hawks, Cooper's Hawks, and more. If you're lucky, you may even spot the beautiful Peregrine Falcon. It's also worth noting this area is one of the only places in the world where you can spot the monarch butterflies on their annual pilgrimage to Mexico.
