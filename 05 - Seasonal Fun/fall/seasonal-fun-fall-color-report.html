			<h3>Fall Color Hunting</h3>
															
			<h4>Best Bets</h4>
			<p>Even though the leaves have been falling around Asheville this week, there is still plenty of color to be seen, especially in the brilliant yellow of the ginkgo trees along Wall Street in Downtown. The Polk County area near Tryon and Saluda is also a good bet, as is the area around Chimney Rock and Lake Lure where color has progressed to the lower elevations. Check out our drive of the week for a scenic day trip that includes both. North of Weaverville along I-26, the leaves are mostly past peak, but beautiful reds and oranges are still visible along the lower flanks of the mountain ranges.</p>
			
			<p><em>Here are other updates from around the mountains:</em></p>

			<h4><a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/">Biltmore</a></h4>
			<p>Fall color is finishing up for the year. Color is getting spotty with the  dark red Red Oaks along estate roads and in the Deer Park. The last of the Sugar Maples are adding yellow and orange, and Sweet Gums, always one of the longest lasting fall color trees, are showing a blend of orange to maroon leaves on the trees along the Swannanoa River. In the gardens, Japanese Maples are highlighting the end of the season with every imaginable fall color, and a few Beeches and Hickories are holding onto their yellow leaves for a few more days.</p>

			<h4><a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Chimney-Rock-at-Chimney-Rock-State-Park/240/default/">Chimney Rock State Park</a></h4>
			<p>Leaf colors exploded at Chimney Rock State Park last week, surrounding the area in brilliant golds, reds and oranges. Peak leaf colors arrived late last week, and the mountains should remain colorful into mid-November if the weather remains calm. The maples are stunning this year, and the red oaks are just now living up to their name. Magnolia trees add a rich chocolate brown to the layers of color. Leaf peepers can find beautiful autumn foliage along the Park's four scenic trails, or try out a rock climbing adventure for a new perspective on autumn.</p>
