<h3>Hop in the Car to Catch Hot Autumn Hues</h3>
<i class="img-right"><img alt="Max Patch in Fall" height="190" width="400" border="0" title="Max Patch in Fall" class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/max-patch-fall-web.jpg" />The sweeping views of <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/hiking-trails/max-patch/">Max Patch</a> offer a rich pallette of fall color.</i>
<p>
Fall color has begun its descent along area mountain slopes with areas around 3,000-4,500 feet in elevation displaying the best color. This offers up a greater number of <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/seasonal-fun/fall/scenic-drives-rides-and-hikes/?tab=mid-fall">drives and hikes</a> perfect for this time of year, and ideal for a sunshine-filled weekend.
</p>
<p>
See fall color from afar by visiting some of the area's grassy balds. Located near milepost 420 on the Blue Ridge Parkway is <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/hiking-trails/black-balsam-trail/">Black Balsam Knob</a> (elevation 6,214 feet). From there, take in the long-range views of the lower mountains, which are now casting an autumn glow. Another great mountain bald to explore is <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/hiking-trails/max-patch/">Max Patch</a> (elevation 4,630 feet). Located west of Asheville along the Appalachian Trail, the views are equally as stunning of the surrounding mountains.
</p>
<p>
With the recent rainfall the mountains have received, this would be a perfect week to visit the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventures/water-adventures/#waterfalls">Cullasaja Gorge</a>. Not only will you get the satisfying crunch of fall leaves under your boots, but you'll also discover this forest is home to a number of beautiful waterfalls. This includes Bridal Veil Falls (which you can drive under), Quarry Falls, and the beautiful 65-foot Dry Falls.

<h3>Mother Nature paints the town red&hellip; and orange&hellip; and yellow</h3>

<i class="img-right"><img height="225" width="400" border="0" title="Looking Glass Rock in Fall" class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/looking-glass-rock-fall-web.jpg" alt="Looking Glass Rock in Fall" />Looking Glass Rock Overlook at Blue Ridge Parkway milepost 417 is<br />
breathtaking this time of year.</i>
According to Fall Color Guy and biologist Dr. Howard Neufeld, the sweet spot for color this week is also the elevation range that encapsulates most of the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/blue-ridge-parkway/">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>, making this the perfect time for a drive up to Looking Glass Rock Overlook at milepost 417. He says, &quot;The red maples, sourwoods, sugar maples, and blueberries and huckleberries are very showy this year.  The reds are especially brilliant, and provide a striking contrast with the yellow and orange colored trees on the landscape.&quot;
</p>
<p>
The crimson hue of dogwoods and red maples is considered by many to be indicative of a great fall color season. (Dr. Neufeld calls this year a 9 out of 10!) You might be surprised to know that, unlike yellow and orange leaves, leaves that turn red actually produce the pigment themselves, a phenomenon we're only beginning to understand. <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/science-behind-fall-color/#theory">Check out some of the theories scientists have on this mystery of fall foliage.</a>

If you like yellow, take a detour off the Parkway on to Highway 276 toward Looking Glass Falls and the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Cradle-of-Forestry/340/default/">Cradle of Forestry</a>, where Devin Gentry says the foliage &quot;is absolutely stunning right now due to the abundance of birch trees that grow along Looking Glass Creek&mdash;every shade of yellow you can think of.&quot;
</p>
<p>
On <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/">Biltmore Estate</a>, horticulture expert Parker Andes is seeing a rainbow of colors, from near-purple to bright orange among the sourwoods, sumac, sweet gum and black gum trees. &quot;Especially nice in the gardens,&quot; he says, &quot;are the deciduous shrubs with sweet shrub, viburnums, oakleaf hydrangea and fothergilla all adding to the colors of the fall blooming chrysanthemums, asters and goldenrods.&quot; Don't miss the stunning chrysanthemum display in the Walled Garden right now.
