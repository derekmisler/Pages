<p>
You won't have to travel far to enjoy fall foliage this week as color has spread throughout Asheville. Elevations between 2,000 and 3,000 feet are experiencing the best color, with the majority of leaves now in transition. Many areas above 3,000 feet are past their prime at this point, but with leaves off the trees you can see amazing long-range views of the surrounding mountains.
</p>
<p>
In Asheville there are a number of great spots to find fall color. Take a drive through the tree-lined streets of <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Montford-Historic-District/323/default/">Montford</a>, where color is surrounding the beautiful Victorian-era homes of this historic neighborhood. You can also stroll through the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/hiking-trails/botanical-gardens/">Botanical Gardens at Asheville</a> to see over 700 species of plants and trees in their full autumn display. Another prime location this week is <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/">Biltmore</a>, which is experiencing brilliant color in the gardens and across the estate.
</p>
<p>
South of Asheville you'll find color along the overlooks of the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/blue-ridge-parkway/">Blue Ridge Parkway</a> until you approach Mount Pisgah, which is past peak at this point. The hiking trails of the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/North-Carolina-Arboretum/26/default/">North Carolina Arboretum</a> and neighboring Bent Creek Experimental Forest are also very colorful this week.
</p>
<p>
Leaves aren't the only things ready to fall off the trees this time of year. Apples are ripe for the picking, and <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/science-behind-fall-color/#fall-color-tour-map">this scenic road trip through the mountains</a> puts you square in the middle of harvest season.

<h3>An explosion of color</h3>

Anyone traveling now through November will be able to find some wonderful fall color through the mid to lower elevations. With a cold snap heading to the mountains this week, trees in the lower elevations will begin to transition quickly. Here's what folks are seeing around the mountains.
</p>
<p>
At <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/The-Omni-Grove-Park-Inn/562/">The Omni Grove Park Inn</a>, which sits atop Sunset Mountain, Tracey tells us the mountains are covered with color. &quot;I think we have 2 more weeks before the strong color fades,&quot; she said.
</p>
<p>
From the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/">Biltmore</a>, Parker expects great color to last through the week. He is seeing &quot;good color on sweet gums, red oaks and sugar maples.  Hickories, sweet birch and beeches are holding onto the last of their bright yellow leaves to brighten up the woodlands with a few sourwoods still adding bright reddish hues.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Shannon from <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Chimney-Rock-at-Chimney-Rock-State-Park/240/default/">Chimney Rock State Park</a> says, &quot;the ridges of the Hickory Nut Gorge are still the star of the show, but fall color is trickling down the mountainside. Yellows remain abundant, especially in the hickories that make our area so famous, with the reds of maples and sourwoods adding gorgeous contrast.&quot;
