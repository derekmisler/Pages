</div>
<p>Welcome spring in high style with more than 130,000 flowers, blooming in gardens fit for a Vanderbilt. At <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/events/index.cfm?action=displayDetail&amp;eventid=2575">Biltmore Blooms</a>, the estate's annual festival of flowers, the color and fragrance of orchids and thousands of spring bulbs steal the show.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/">George Vanderbilt decided to build his 250-room family home in the mountains of Western North Carolina</a>, he hired renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted (also known for his role in designing New York's Central Park) to help his estate make a statement. Biltmore Blooms celebrates the natural progression of blooms dictated by Mother Nature and arranged by Olmsted and by the estate's current team of expert gardeners and horticulturists.</p>

<h3>Opulent orchids on Display</h3>
<p>In the early days of spring, visitors to the estate can experience nearly 1,000 orchids in full bloom, showing off their tropical colors and exotic look. Check out the Conservatory to see a wide variety of species, but also take a look inside Biltmore House.</p>
<p>For a limited time March 20 through April 6, guests will be given the rare opportunity to step into the Winter Garden in Biltmore House (typically roped off to guests) to admire the sights and fragrances of a special orchid collection. This bright, glass-domed garden room was once used by the Vanderbilts to relax and entertain in their home while surrounded by lush exotic plants.</p>
<p>Visitors in the Conservatory can also expect live music offered daily.</p>
<h3>In the Gardens</h3>

<p>The daffodils and forsythia take the stage first in the 75+ acres of landscaped gardens across the Biltmore Estate.</p>
<p>Next come 96,000 tulips, which transform the 4-acre Walled Garden into a can't-miss floral paradise. The tulips bloom in pink, peach, purple and white and last 3-4 weeks before making way for later season blooms in the shrub and azalea gardens.</p>
<p>From here, native azalea species, rhododendron, roses and other vibrant annuals and perennials steal the show.</p>
<h3>Savor the Season</h3>

<p>For those looking to enjoy the outdoors or a fine glass of wine amid the splendor of spring blooms, the Biltmore Winery and Antler Hill Village should be the next stop. America's most-visited winery offers daily tastings of it's limited release spring wine, as well as the new <a href="http://www.biltmore.com/visit/things-to-do/tours" target="_blank">Vine to Wine Tour</a> that takes oenopiles to the estate's vineyard and ends with a grand tasting.</p>
<p>The barnyard animals at Antler Hill Farm are waiting to welcome families with baby goats, lambs chicks and bunnies, and kids will also enjoy the weekend grape stomps outside the winery.</p>
<p>Antler Hill Village will feature live music on the bandstand Saturday&#8211;Thurstday during the Biltmore Blooms celebration.</p>
