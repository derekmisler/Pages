		<h2><span class="red">#2.</span><br />River Views with French Broad Overview to Marshall</h2>
		<h4>Why go?</h4>
		<p>N.C. 251 was built along old Indian trading paths, which the Indians used to cross through the mountains to trading posts and villages in the Tennessee and Ohio River valleys. Over the years, the river cut away at the rock valley walls leaving a relatively flat river bed. For the Indians, and later the settlers, river beds were the easiest places to build paths, roads and railroads. Look for mountain laurel and other wildflowers as you drive.</p>
		<h4>Scenic drive time:</h4>
		<p>1 hour round&ndash;trip</h6>
		<h4>Directions:</h4>
		<p>Take U.S. 19&ndash;23 north out of Asheville. Take the Weaverville exit to begin a 14&ndash;mile scenic drive along the French Broad Overview by driving along U.S. 25&ndash;70 Bypass toward Marshall.

Turn right onto N.C. 251 near the town of Alexander. Continue on N.C. 251 after it meets with U.S. 25&ndash;70 Business until you come to Marshall. This little town is the seat of Madison County and was named for Chief Justice John Marshall in 1852. Stop in Marshall for lunch or have a picnic along the river. To return to Asheville, you can retrace your path along the French Broad Overview or follow US 25&ndash;70 Business until it reaches US 25&ndash;70 Bypass. Follow the bypass to U.S. 19&ndash;23 at Weaverville.
