Advance tickets are a must for this one.</p>
<p>Children of all ages will believe in the magic of Christmas after a ride on The Polar Express on the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Great-Smoky-Mountains-Railroad/128/default/">Great Smoky Mountains Railroad</a>. Faces light up as the train arrives at the North Pole to pick up Santa. Along the way, enjoy music, cocoa, singing and storytelling. And take home your own silver sleigh bell! Trips begin in early November.</p>
<p>Give the gift of laughter by taking friends and family on a zany <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/LaZoom-Comedy-Tour/293/default/">LaZoom Holiday Tour</a>.

Their talented tour performers show you a hysterically, historical side of Asheville. Tours run daily mid November through New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>Watch Santa practice for the big night on one of the biggest chimneys in the world. On two Saturdays in December, Santa rappels from the top of <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Chimney-Rock-at-Chimney-Rock-State-Park/240/default/">Chimney Rock at Chimney Rock State Park</a>.
