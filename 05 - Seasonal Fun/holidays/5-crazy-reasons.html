		<h3>(Really) Rockin' Holiday Parade</h3>
		<p>	Hot off his win and national tour, <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2014/05/american-idol-homecoming.html"><em>American Idol</em> champion Caleb Johnson</a> is heading home for the holidays, where he will be the grand marshal for the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/events/index.cfm?action=displayDetail&amp;eventid=4691&amp;parentID=196">Asheville Holiday Parade</a> on November 22.
