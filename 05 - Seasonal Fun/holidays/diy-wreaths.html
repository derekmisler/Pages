<p>The tradition of wreath making goes well beyond Christmas cheer, encompassing histories of ancient cultures from around the world and signifying love, protection, friendship, life and rebirth. What began as a handmade garland worn around the head in Egypt and Grease, has today evolved into an icon celebrating births, weddings, harvest, Easter, the start of the new year, and of course, Christmas. Traditional reeds are usually made of natural materials such as evergreen branches, Holly, Scotch pine, or boxwood. However, wreathes are not limited to fresh greenery. Everything from ornaments, tinsel and stuffed animals can be incorporated into the design.</p>

<ul class="big-numbers">
	<li><p>Use materials that are readily available and easy to find, whether in the backyard or at the local craft supply store. Don't forget that broken ornaments can easily be &ldquo;recycled&rdquo; when tucked (and secured with wire or a hot glue gun) into a wreath.</p></li>
	<li><p>Hang fresh greenery on the chimney wall. Not only will this be a nice focal point in the room, but the heat of roaring fire will intensify that wonderful, woodsy scent. For dried or silk materials, a few drops of your favorite scented oil is a nice touch.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use your imagination when thinking about the perfect wreath this season. Attaching children's toys (especially if the kids are grown is a nice) is a personal touch that makes a lasting keepsake to treasure. Using Christmas cards from loved ones is also a fun and colorful way to decorate.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use dried flowers from a special occasion as a memento in your wreath. Store it carefully in an airtight container (a small amount of silica gel will help absorb moisture) and hang it up every year as a reminder of that cherished time.</p></li>
	<li><p>Remember that a delicate dried wreath should not be placed on a door that is constantly opened and shut. Also, intense heat and bright sunlight may fade dried plant material, so be careful where you hang it.</p></li>
	<li><p>Try giving homemade wreaths as gifts this season. Friends and family will appreciate the time and thoughtfulness that goes into making this type of present.</p></li>
	<li><p>The large bow does not always have to be the focal point of the wreath. Instead, try dried fruits and berries, clusters of hard candy or a large Christmas ornament. Build the rest of your wreath from there, until you have covered the desired amount of space.</p></li>
	<li><p>Place objects in your wreath at varied directions and different depths within the greenery to keep it from looking too planed or stiff.</p></li>
	<li><p>Be imaginative when considering placement of your wreath as part of your overall holiday d√©cor. Don't limit yourself to just hanging one on the wall or on the front door. While you'll probably want to include one or more in those places, also try using a wreath as a centerpiece on your table or leaning in a windowsill.</p></li>
