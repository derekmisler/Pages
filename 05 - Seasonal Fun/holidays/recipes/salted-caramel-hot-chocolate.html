<h5>Caramel Sauce:</h5>
<ul class="big-numbers">
	<li>
	<p>
	1 cup granulated sugar
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	&frac14; cup water
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	&frac14; cup salted butter
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	â…” cup heavy cream
	</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<ul class="big-numbers">
	<li>
	<p>
	For the carmel sauce:&nbsp;Gather all of your ingredients and have them nearby ready to add to the mixture as needed. In a heavy-bottomed 3 quart saucepan, heat sugar and water over moderately high heat whisking constantly to dissolve sugar. Once mixture reaches a boil, stop whisking and allow mixture to boil until it reaches a dark amber color, carefully swirling pan occasionally.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	Once mixture reaches a dark amber color, immediately add butter and whisk until butter has melted then immediately remove from heat. Wait 3 seconds then carefully pour in cream and immediately whisk to combine (it will bubble vigorously). Whisk until mixture is smooth. Allow caramel to cool several minutes then pour into a glass jar to cool.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	While caramel sauce is cooling, heat milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once milk is warm, stir in chocolate chips and caramel, and cook, whisking constantly until chocolate has melted.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	Allow to cool slightly and serve warm, topped with sweetened whipped cream or miniature marshmallows. Drizzle each serving with 1 Tbsp caramel sauce and garnish with grated chocolate if desired.
	</p>

	<b>NOTE:</b> For a richer hot chocolate, you can use up to &frac12; cup bittersweet chocolate chips and mix in more caramel sauce as well if desired.
