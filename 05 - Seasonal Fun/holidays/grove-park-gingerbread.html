<p>The Omni Grove Park Inn is spectacular any time of the year, but it is during the holiday season that the hotel and its Great Hall come alive with the smells of evergreen, sugar and spice.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find no shortage of holiday spirit, music or decorations at The Omni Grove Park Inn. The Great Hall&#8217;s enormous wreath-adorned stone fire places&#8212;large enough accommodate massive 12-foot logs&#8212;crackle and glow with welcomed warmth. Throughout the Inn there are dozens of decorated trees; the largest resides in the Great Hall. And the lobby rings with the sounds of Christmas.</p>
<h3>Sugar and Spice and Everything Nice at The Omni Grove Park Inn</h3>
<p>If only the thick boulder-rock walls of The Omni Grove Park Inn could talk. What stories they would tell about the captains of industry, politicians, prize-winning authors, artists, and sports legends who have walked through its massive oak doors.</p>
<p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the Inn stands as a prime example of the Arts and Crafts movement in American and to one man&#8217;s contribution to the &#8220;Golden Age of Asheville.&#8221; Just as in 1913, when the Inn officially opened, today&#8217;s visitors are drawn to its expansive exterior and breathtaking location, overlooking Asheville and the ancient mountains that surround this vibrant southern city.</p>
<p>From its Arts and Crafts Roycroft furniture and accessories to displays of antique china and caricatures of its many famous guests, The Omni Grove Park Inn is overflowing with history.</p>
