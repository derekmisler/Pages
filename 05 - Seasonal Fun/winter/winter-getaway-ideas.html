<h4>Cinema and cocoa</h4>
<p>
Get out of the cold and out of your typical routine with a night out watching an indie film at the Fine Arts Theatre, situated in an Art Deco building downtown. Afterwards, hit one of the area's many downtown coffee shops for a steamy cup of cocoa or Joe, such as the Double Decker bus, Malaprop's Bookstore and Cafe or True Confections. For the true film buff, also check out some of the Asheville area spots where major Hollywood films were shot.
