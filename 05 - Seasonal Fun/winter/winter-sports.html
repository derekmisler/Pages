<h3>Hiking</h3>
<p>Some would say winter is the best season for hiking in the Southern Appalachians. Free from the heat of summer, one can enjoy the crisp cool air and stunning views revealed by leafless trees. But don't worry&#8212;there's no need to break out the snow shoes. All that's required is a sturdy pair of boots and lots of warm layers.

<h3>Skiing, Snowboarding, and Snow Tubing</h3>

<p>A winter stay in Asheville puts skiers, snowboarders and snow tubers about 30 minutes away from the closest slopes, and just over an hour from some of the highest ski peaks east of the Mississippi River, with elevations over 5,500'. Be sure to check out our <a title="Seasonal Packages" href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/packages-deals/seasonal/">winter vacation packages</a> or <a title="Where to Stay in Asheville" href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/hotels/">find a room</a>.</p>
<p>The highest Carolina mountain peaks average 60 inches of snow a year and expert snow makers keep the powder fresh. The Asheville area, at a lower elevation, stays relatively snow-free for much of the season. This makes travelling to the resorts, all <strong>within 45 minutes</strong>, easy with little or no snow on the ground.</p>

<h4>Ridge Lodge</h4>
<p>Relax in this 22,000 sq. ft. glass and timber lodge located adjacent to Wolf Ridge Ski Resort and near the top of the slopes, and has a commanding view of the mountains and valleys below. Warm up and relax at The Ridge Lodge around the large fireplace. There is ample room for families and guests to relax.</p>
<h4>Base Lodge</h4>
<p>The Base Lodge is a large rustic lodge nestled at the bottom of the slopes, featuring three large fireplaces where guests can warm up and a large viewing deck and glassed viewing area where family members&#8212;not braving the elements&#8212;may sit and watch the action on the slopes.</p>
