<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/docs/reunion-planning-toolkit.pdf" target="_blank">Download our toolkit here</a> and follow along.</p>
<h3>Form a Planning Committee</h3>
<p>If you are planning an event for more than 25 people, it will be helpful to establish reunion officers and planning committees. Committees may include Hotel Selection, Budget, Fundraising, Correspondence, Programming &amp; Activities, Food or Catering, Setup &amp; Breakdown, Registration and Decorations.</p>
<p>You may also want to survey potential reunion attendees to help committees plan the details and understand expectations. Send the survey via email, or create an event page on Facebook to get feedback that will help with planning.</p>
<h3>Create a Timeline</h3>
<p>A timeline outlining the steps of your planning process will help you get organized and stay on track. We've included a sample 18-24 month planning timelime. Smaller reunions may only require a 6 month timeline.</p>
<h3>Prepare Reunion Budget</h3>
<p>As important as a timeline, preparing and sticking to a budget will help make your reunion a success.</p>
<h3>Glossary</h3>
<p>If you are new to event planning, we've included a glossary of commonly-used industry terms.</p>
<h3>Select Reunion Dates</h3>
<p>You may want to plan around the busiest months of the year to help keep costs down. The months of January, Feburary and March offer the best value. If you want a summertime reunion, late May and the month of June are less busy times for hotels in Asheville. In the fall, September rates are generally lower than October's. Also, choosing dates that fall during week days will help you find a lower rate.</p>
<h3>Select a Host Hotel</h3>
<p>Selecting the host hotel of your reunion can take a lot of time and research. The Asheville Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau sales manager can make this process easier by contacting the properties that fit your criteria and requesting rates and proposals on your behalf.</p>
<p>Our reunion manager will send this information to the properties that fit your criteria and proposals will be sent to you directly. The hotel proposals will outline the room rate and other information about holding your event at the property. It is the responsibility of the reunion planner to review the proposals and select the host hotel or hotels. Once a host has been selected, please contact the CVB to inform us of your decision.</p>
<h3>Travel Guides and Maps for Attendees</h3>
<p>The CVB Group Services Department can provide travel guides and maps for your reunion attendees. Complimentary plastic bags and souvenirs are also available based on the number of overnight accommodations being used by the group. Call (828) 258-6106 to make arrangements.</p>
<h3>Reunion Activities</h3>

<p class="info"><strong>Please note:</strong> After the contract is signed, your reunion attendees will need to book the rooms from the block of rooms the hotel is holding for you. If members miss the deadline for the room block, they may pay more for their accommodations.</p>
<p class="legal">Contract negotiations are between the planner and the hotel; the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau does not take part in that aspect of the process.</p>
