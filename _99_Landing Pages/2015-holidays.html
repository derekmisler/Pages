<h1>Celebrate the Season in the Mountains</h1>

<p>In Asheville we’re in the holiday mood—and with good reason. The holiday season here means the grandeur of America’s largest home, Biltmore, is lit by candles and firelight, the North Carolina Arboretum is aglow with three acres of artistic light displays, and the Omni Grove Park Inn is hosting their incredible 23rd National Gingerbread House Competition.</p>

<p>And the festivities don’t stop there, other events include holiday theatre and concert performances, art walks and the Big Crafty juried crafters show. See the Events Calendar for dates and times.</p>

<p>How do you decorate a 250-room house for the season? Well if you’re Biltmore House you start on the front lawn with a 55-foot Norway spruce lit with 45,000 lights. Inside the grand Banquet Hall nothing less than a 35-foot fir bedecked with 1000 ornaments will do. Throughout the house you’ll find dozens of other decorated trees, miles of live garland and sumptuous ribbons, and fireplaces burning brightly.</p>
	
<p>Omni Grove Park Inn decks its historic halls with elaborate theme-decorated trees. Sprinkled amongst the firs you’ll find incredible entries from the 23rd National Gingerbread House Competition. Made completely out of edible materials, these incredible creations are true engineering marvels and an astonishing sight to behold.</p>

<p>Nothing says holidays like The North Carolina Arboretum’s Winter Lights display where thousands of colorful lights artfully adorn three acres of garden exhibits and landscapes. Animated displays illuminate to the music of the season and cozy firepits where you and yours can toast marshmallows dot the gardens, adding to the festive mood.</p>
