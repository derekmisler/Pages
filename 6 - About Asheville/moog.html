<h2>More About Moog Music</h2>
<h3>American Made</h3>
<img src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/Bucket-List-7.jpg" class="img-right imgshadow">
<p><strong>Bob Moog</strong> is a well-known legend in the music industry. In fact, in many ways he was a pioneer. Having invented the Moog Synthesizer back in the 1960&#8217;s, Moog revolutionized the way we enjoy music today. You would be hard pressed to find any major band that isn&#8217;t using a Moog instrument, and each one is handmade right here in Asheville.</p>
<p>The Moog factory opened the doors to their new headquarters in 2011 on the border of downtown Asheville. Here they produce high-end musical equipment for some of your favorite musicians. Four types of synthesizers are produced by hand in the factory, the largest taking four people and 260 minutes to produce just one. A total of 12,000 units are produced annually.</p>
<p>You can tour the Moog factory and see the production up close. There&#8217;s no charge to go through the factory. They also have a shop on hand if you&#8217;re in the market for a synthesizer.</p>
<h3>Animoog</h3>
<img src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/images/moogfest.jpg" class="img-right imgshadow">
<p>Moog Music also launched the number one selling app on the iTunes market in 2011. It&#8217;s called <strong>Animoog</strong> and a number of musicians have already started using the app to craft music directly from their iPad&#8217;s. The app projects imagery as you play and gives you all the tools you need to craft your own electronic masterpiece. <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2011/10/americas-number-one-selling-ipad-app.html" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank">More about that here</a>.</p>
<h3>Moogfest</h3>
<p>By far one of the greatest festivals to hit the Asheville scene is Moogfest. With solid line-ups consisting of musical pioneers (think <strong>Moby</strong>, <strong>Brian Eno</strong>, <strong>Devo</strong> and more), the electronic celebration of Bob Moog&#8217;s legacy is an event not to be missed. This event occurs in the fall season and typically hits around the Halloween weekend, adding a little personality to the mix of concertgoers. Be on the lookout for updates starting in September.</p>
