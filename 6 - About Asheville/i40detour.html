	<h4>Detour Option via Dixie Highway</h4>
	<p><strong class="bigger-strong">Detour 1:</strong> Westbound travelers from Asheville may take I-26 West from Asheville toward Weaverville, taking exit 19 for 25/70 Dixie Highway through the town of Hot Springs. Follow signs to stay on 25/70 through Newport, Tennessee to reconnect with I-40 West. This route adds roughly 30 minutes to travel time and is a beautiful scenic mountain highway. Passenger vehicles only are permitted on this roadâ€“it is not a commercial travel route (i.e. motorcoach, RVs or dual-axle vehicles). Please consider possible weather and traffic congestion issues on this winding two-lane road.</p>
	<h4>Express Route via Scenic Interstate Byway</h4>
	<p><strong class="bigger-strong">Detour 2:</strong> The NC Department of Transportation advises that westbound travelers should take I-26 West from Asheville, heading north toward Johnson City, then continue on I-81 South (exit 8A) in Tennessee back to I-40. The I-26 route adds roughly 50 minutes to travel time and is one of the nation's only interstate Scenic Byways. I-26 takes motorists through the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains offering scenic observation points, a welcome center and stunning views of the highest peaks in the East.</p>
	<p class="">NOTE: Travelers heading west from Asheville to Cherokee, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Cataloochee Ski Area, Haywood County and points west should take exit 27 off I-40 (Great Smoky Mountains Expy/US-19/US-23/US-74).</p>
