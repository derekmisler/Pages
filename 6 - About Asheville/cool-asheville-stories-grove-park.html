<p class="intro">When E.W. Grove set his mind to building his Inn he created a landmark that was built for the ages. Using the fortune he amassed selling his Tasteless Chill Tonic, Grove began buying up the farmland on Sunset Mountain in Asheville. Construction began in 1912 and was completed in less than a year. The Inn officially opened for business on July 12, 1913.</p>

<h3>Architectural Wonder</h3>
<p>The Omni Grove Park Inn is granite-built using boulders hauled down from Sunset Mountain by hundreds of mules, wagons and ropes. Building with granite meant there was much less risk of fire in contrast to many timber buildings of the era.</p>

<p>The Great Hall was constructed with two enormous fireplaces, each one spanning 36 feet in width. It required 120 boulders to build each one and they both stretch two stories high. Tucked inside these structures are elevators leading to the guest rooms, and these lifts are still in use to this day.</p>

<p>The Omni Grove Park Inn was originally outfitted with seven hundred pieces of furniture and over 600 lighting fixtures of solid copper made by hand by the Roycrofters, innovators in the world of arts and craft furnishings. Because many of these pieces are still in use, the Omni Grove Park Inn has the largest collection of arts and crafts furniture than any other resort in the U.S.</p>

<h3>Omni Grove Park Inn's Ghost</h3>
<p>The Pink Lady is one of Omni Grove Park Inn's most notorious guests. She checked in during the early 1920's and to this day has never left. Lore states that an unidentified woman wearing a flowing pink gown fell from the fifth floor of the Palm Court where she met her untimely demise. Ever since, there have been hundreds of sightings of her ghost wandering through the Inn. Some guests have had their hair suddenly stand on end or felt slight tugs on their ear. Others have experienced an unexplainable chill in the air.</p>
<p>In 1995, the Omni Grove Park Inn commissioned Joshua P. Warren, a paranormal investigator, to investigate. He discovered tumultuous energies surrounding the area where the Pink Lady had passed away, but by all accounts surmised that she was a benevolent spirit.</p>

<h3>Legendary Luxury</h3>
<p>The resort features an <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Golf-Course-at-The-Grove-Park-Inn/172/default/">18-hole golf course</a> designed by Donald Ross, a pioneer in his field. The par 70 course has hosted numerous PGA Tour events and has been visited by golfing greats Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus.  Even <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/about-asheville/cool-asheville-stories/presidential-itinerary/">President Obama</a> enjoyed this award-winning course during his visit to Asheville in 2010.</p>
<p>Adding a touch of world-class luxury, the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/The-Spa-at-The-Grove-Park-Inn/265/default/">Spa at Omni Grove Park Inn</a> was added in early 2001. The subterranean sanctuary was constructed almost exclusively in stone and took two years to complete. It includes a mineral pool that plays underwater music, multiple indoor waterfalls, steam rooms, saunas and plunge pools. It quickly became, and still is, one of the premier spas in the country.</p>
