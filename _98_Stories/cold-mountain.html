Author <a target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window" href="http://www.salon.com/july97/colddiary970709.html">Charles Frazier</a> found inspiration for what he calls his &quot;American odyssey&quot; in the mountainous backwoods near Asheville and in the area's local history and unique culture. &quot;Whenever I'm back in those mountains, I feel like that's home, no matter how long I've been away,&quot; <a target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window" href="http://www.bookbrowse.com/index.cfm?page=author&amp;authorID=239&amp;view=interview">says Frazier</a>, whose family has lived in the hills of North Carolina for over 200 years. &quot;That's the place I know the best, and the place that in my imagination sums up all those things about being rooted and knowing a place and having a place.&quot;

Despite the international success of the book and movie &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; few people realize that Cold Mountain is a real place that looms well above the horizon southwest of Asheville, an eclectic town nestled in the Western North Carolina mountains. During the Civil War era, the Land of Sky, as Asheville was once known, was just beginning to transform itself from a thriving hub for livestock drovers to the sophisticated resort that it would soon become. Today, Asheville is just a short scenic drive from the real Cold Mountain and many other places you can go to <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/about-asheville/cool-asheville-stories/cold-mountain/visit-cold-mountain/" title="Visit Cold Mountain">walk in the footsteps</a> of Inman and Ada.
