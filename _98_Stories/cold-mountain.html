Today, Asheville is just a short scenic drive from the real Cold Mountain and many other places you can go to <a data-sv-linklookup-id="55e8a46b7dbe5eb34d7c472a" data-sv-linklookup-type="plugins_blog_blog_post_story_blog" href="#" title="Visit Cold Mountain">walk in the footsteps</a> of Inman and Ada.</p>
