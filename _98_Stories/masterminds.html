<p>
When heist comedy <i>Masterminds</i> hits theaters in October 2015, movie goers who know Asheville, N.C. may see some familiar sites.
</p>
<p>
Several local spots make cameo appearances in the film, such as downtown Asheville's Pack Square and BB&amp;T building, which was disguised as a different bank for the film, and the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/US-Cellular-Center/17/default/">U.S. Cellular Center</a>, which had a small starring role as a Mexican airport. Other scenes were shot in nearby towns like Old Fort and Waynesville.
</p>

Downtown Asheville even has a starring role in the official trailer for the film, which is based on a true story:

But the real stars of the show&mdash;including comedy A-listers Owen Wilson, Zach Galifianakis and Kristen Wiig&mdash;got into a few shenanigans of their own during the weeks of filming this past summer. Here's a look at what they did when they weren't on the set:

<h3>Where They Ate</h3>

<p>
All of that pretend criminal activity made for a very hungry cast, and actors were spotted in several popular Asheville restaurants throughout the summer. Kristen Wiig, who was seen at <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/C-rate/476/default/">Curate tapas bar</a> and <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2013/04/farm-burger-asheville.html">Farm Burger</a>, even <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2014/09/kristen-wiig-celebrates-ashevilles.html">mentioned Asheville's &quot;great restaurants&quot; to David Letterman</a> on <i>The Late Show</i>. 
</p>
<p>
Owen Wilson joined <i>Saturday Night Live</i> alumnus Jason Sudeikis for a wood-fired pie at <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/All-Souls-Pizza/5628/default/">All Souls Pizza</a>. Western North Carolina native Zach Galifianakis was spotted enjoying barbecue at the famed <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/12-Bones-Smokehouse/381/default/">12 Bones Smokehouse</a>. And film producer and SNL creator Lorne Michaels dined at <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/The-Market-Place/406/default/">The Market Place</a> and <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Cucina-24/445/default/">Cucina 24</a>, both on downtown's Wall Street.

The stars were also excited to sample Asheville's beverage scene, sipping craft beers at <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Lexington-Avenue-Brewery/436/default/">Lexington Avenue Brewery</a> and at McCormick Field during one of the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Tourists-Baseball-Club/310/default/">Asheville Tourists'</a> Thirsty Thursday events, and trying creative cocktails at <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/The-Imperial-Life/4224/default/">The Imperial Life</a> and <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Lex-18-Moonshine-Bar-and-Restaurant/5950/default/">Lex18</a>. Owen Wilson also visited a local tailgate market to pick up fresh juices from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/roamingintheraw">Roaming in the Raw</a> and dropped by the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Battery-Park-Book-Exchange-Champagne-Bar/113/default/">Battery Park Book Exchange</a> for coffee.

<h3>What They Did</h3>
<p>
But it wasn't all about the eats for the <i>Masterminds </i>cast-some also took advantage of Asheville's offerings to unwind and let loose after a day of work. In her interview with Letterman, Kristen Wiig shared that she liked to relax by meditating in the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Salt-Cave/4254/default/">Asheville Salt Cave</a> and visiting the sensory deprivation room at <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Still-Point-Wellness/5529/default/">Still Point Wellness</a>. And Owen Wilson chose to cool off at <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Sliding-Rock-A-Natural-Water-Slide/284/default/">Sliding Rock</a>, the area's 60-foot natural water slide.
