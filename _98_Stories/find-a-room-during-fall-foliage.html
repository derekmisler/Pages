<p>Getting a room at an Asheville area hotel or bed &amp; breakfast can be quite difficult in the fall. Here are a few tips to make sure you have somewhere to lay your head after a long day of leaf peeping.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Book your room before coming to town. Don&rsquo;t assume you&rsquo;ll find one once you&rsquo;re here. Chances are, you won&rsquo;t.</li>
	<li>Come to town Sunday through Thursday nights. Room availability at accommodations increases and rates tend to run a little less if you stay during these days.</li>
	<li>Book your room for November, when there is more availability than there is during the popular October leaf peeping season and, due to warm weather into the fall, there is still expected to be plenty of fall color in the area.</li>
</ol>
