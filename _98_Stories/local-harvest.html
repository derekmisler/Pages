<p>
Though some close in November, plenty of holiday and indoor markets remain open, offering timeless (and season-less) Appalachian products like meats, cheese and crafts. Throughout autumn, tailgates and roadside stands are stocked with edible and decorative gourds, fall harvest arrangements and wreaths, various vegetables and more than enough jarred and packaged goods for stocking stuffers and Appalachian gifts.

<h4>Oh honey, honey</h4>
<p>
Asheville is also Bee City USA. The area loves its pollinators, which make possible up to two-thirds of what we eat. Wild Mountain Bees is a bee-centric store offering local honey, beekeeping needs and honey-based beauty products. It also has demonstrations geared toward both the advanced and aspiring beekeeper.
