<p>&quot;Quiet on the set!&quot; is not a phrase you think you&rsquo;d hear while admiring the serene beauty of the peaks in Western North Carolina. But, more and more Hollywood producers have found that these 6,000-foot peaks provide visually spectacular backdrops for the motion picture industry.</p>

<p>&quot;North Carolina has more production complexes and sound stages than any state in the nation outside of California,&quot; said Asheville resident Michael Bigham, North Carolina locations manager for <em>Last of the Mohicans</em> and a Hollywood scout for <em>The Hunger Games</em> and other productions.</p>

<p>And Western North Carolina captured the attention of Hollywood years ago. The first movie shot in Asheville was in the 1920s. Titled <em>Conquest of Canaan</em>, the movie was filmed in what is now Pack Square in downtown Asheville, and tells the story of a lawyer who makes good in a small town.</p>

<p>Here are a few other examples of Hollywood films and their Western North Carolina locations:</p>
