Where there's corn, you're bound to find corn mazes. The Eliada Annual Corn Maze twists through 12 acres of corn fields with a hay-bale trail geared toward younger kids. Corn cannons, a corn-kernel sandbox and pumpkin patches round out the family-friendly farm fun. Taylor Ranch also hosts corn mazes in autumn on its working horse and cattle ranch.
