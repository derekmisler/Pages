<p>A magical forest that takes you into the heart of the Pisgah National Forest. Although the cave that Katniss and Peeta use for shelter was created on a soundstage, the rocky area and creek surrounding it are in the Corner Rock area of the forest. This part of the forest was also used to shoot some of the District 12 hunting scenes.</p>
<p>From Asheville, take US 19-23/I-26 W for about 11 miles. Take Exit 15 to Jupiter/Barnardsville and turn right, following NC 197 about 6 miles to the town of Barnardsville.

When the road turns to gravel you have reached the forest boundary.</p>

<h5>Points of Interest:</h5>

	<li>Corner Rock - From the metal gate at the entrance to the forest, go exactly 1.6 miles along the gravel road. Look for a place to pull off on the left side of the road and for a blocked-off road leading into the woods. Park here, and begin walking up this blocked road-there should be a small stream on your right. After about one-quarter of a mile, look for a large rock on your right next to the stream. Walk around to the far side of the rock to see the spot used in the film.</li>
