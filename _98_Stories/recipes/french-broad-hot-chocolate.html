<h3>Ingredients for Hot Chocolate</h3>
<ul>
	
	<li>8 oz. ganache (1 recipe from above)</li>
	<li>24 oz. organic whole milk</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Combine milk and ganache in a large saucepan over med/low heat.</li>
	<li>Stir constantly with a whisk, until the mixture starts to simmer (you want some bubbles, but not a rapid boil).</li>
	<li>Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Modify</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Variation 1</strong>&#8212;To make the French Broad Chocolate Lounge's signature Liquid Truffle:  Replace 24 oz. whole milk with 10 oz. half &amp; half.  Proceed with recipe.  This makes a rich, indulgent sipping chocolate.  Serve small 4 oz portions, as it's very rich!</li>
	<li><strong>Variation 2</strong>&#8212;Sprinkle the hot chocolate with equal parts cayenne pepper and cinnamon.</li>
	<li><strong>Variation 3</strong>&#8212;Add a drop of peppermint essential oil to the hot chocolate as it cooks (or more to taste, but this stuff is strong!)</li>
</ul>
