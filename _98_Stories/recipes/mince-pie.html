<p>These delightful little pies are a tradition in England during the month of December. The Victorians would have used mincemeat that actually included meat, but the recipe has been refined to be a blend of apple, dried fruits, nuts and brandy which is aged for two to four months before using.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/carolina-bed-and-breakfast/647/">Carolina Bed &amp; Breakfast</a>, innkeeper Susan Murray makes her own mincemeat in September for the coming Christmas season, but a commercial variety can be used as well (although you may want to moisten it with a bit more brandy and adjust the spices to your taste).</p>
