Local foragers like <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/?action=display&amp;listingID=4079&amp;tab=">Alan Muskat</a>, featured on Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, know how to find forest delicacies like morel and chanterelle mushrooms. April through October, Muskat runs the Wild Foods Market, selling fungus and other edibles culled from the woods. He's also keen to teach amateurs the ways of the wild. Muskat regularly runs foraging expeditions, tailor-made to explore everything from backwoods hollers to the grand fields of the Biltmore Estate, according to your whims.

If mushrooms aren't quite your speed, Appalachian woods burst with berries&mdash;wine berries, blueberries, black raspberries and more&mdash;from June through first frost. Visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.longbrancheec.org/">Long Branch Educational Center</a> to find these fruits and others available for the picking.

<h4>Go fish</h4>

In the mountains of Asheville, fall harvest hiking is tough to beat, and the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventures/blue-ridge-parkway/">Blue Ridge Parkway</a> offers numerous trails on which to leaf peep. But harvest season also means an abundance of trout in the Nantahala River, which is stocked with rainbow, brook and brown trout in the early fall. Trout require cold, clean water, so the mountains streams around Asheville provide the perfect environment. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncwildlife.org/Learning/Species/Fish/Trout/TroutFishing.aspx">The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission</a> has plenty of information about local trout, as well as how to get licensed.

No time for fishing? Visit Sunburst Trout Farms in Canton, where three generations of trout farmers have raised some of the best freshwater trout in the Southeast in water flowing from the Shining Rock Wilderness of Pisgah National Forest. The farm, which has a retail store offering everything from cold-smoked, gravlax-style trout to trout jerky, is open for visitors several days a week.
