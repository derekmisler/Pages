<h4>Eligibility and Judging</h4>
<p>There will be two rounds of voting. Who picks the winners in round one? You do! And your friends&#8212;plus about 43,300 of Asheville's closest fans.</p>
<p>The top ten photos from viewer's choice will undergo a final vote by the judging panel at the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/contact/" target="_blank">Asheville Convention and Visitor's Bureau</a> (ACVB). They will ultimately choose the grand prize winner.</p>
<p>All photos are pre-screened. Photos depicting nudity, profanity, commercial or political interests, or anything wildly off-topic are strictly prohibited. The Asheville CVB reserves the right to disqualify any photographs deemed inappropriate.</p>
<p>If you choose to include people in your submission, you are responsible for obtaining the necessary releases from the individuals depicted, and must be able to provide copies of those releases to the ACVB upon request.</p>
<p>Submissions may be watermarked if desired, but the watermark should be inconspicuous enough to not interfere with the judging of the photo. A watermarked photo might not be honored by the competition (at the judges sole discretion) if the photographer is unable or unavailable to provide a pristine, watermark-free version of the image when asked.</p>
<p>Images will be judged on originality, technical excellence, composition, overall impact and artistic merit. The judges are a panel of ACVB staff members familiar with photography and responsible for selecting images for various Asheville's printed and online marketing.</p>
<p>The Asheville CVB shall determine winner eligibility in its sole and absolute discretion. All decisions made by the judges are final.</p>
