<p>Nestled in a verdant Blue Ridge Mountain valley and framed by the highest peaks along the Blue Ridge Parkway, Asheville, NC is a thriving community of culinary creatives.</p>
<p>Stretching back to George W. Vanderbilt's tradition of serving Biltmore guests culinary delights grown right on the estate of America's Largest Home, Asheville looks to the land for inspiration. Here, a farmer's bounty, enhanced by a chef's inspiration and complemented by an artisan's handiwork, creates dining transcendence.</p>
<p>With 15 active farmers' markets, 250+ independent restaurants, 18 fantastic craft breweries and hundreds of inspired local products&#8212;all within a city of 85,000&#8212;Asheville gleefully blurs the lines between art, food and mountain culture, pushing the boundaries of the plate and charting new territory in craft beer and cocktails. Local sake or hard cider anyone? <em>Grab a chair and join us&#8230;</em></p>
