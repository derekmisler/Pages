<p>Nestled in a verdant Blue Ridge Mountain valley and framed by the highest peaks along the Blue Ridge Parkway, Asheville, NC is a thriving community of culinary creatives.</p>
<p>Stretching back to George W. Vanderbilt's tradition of serving Biltmore guests culinary delights grown right on the estate of America's Largest Home, Asheville looks to the land for inspiration. Here, a farmer's bounty, enhanced by a chef's inspiration and complemented by an artisan's handiwork, creates dining transcendence.</p>
<p>With 15 active farmers' markets, 250+ independent restaurants, 18 fantastic craft breweries, Americaâ€™s most visited winery at Biltmore and hundreds of inspired local products&#8212;all within a city of 85,000&#8212;Asheville gleefully blurs the lines between art, food and mountain culture, pushing the boundaries of the plate and charting new territory in craft beer and cocktails. Local sake or hard cider anyone? <em>Grab a chair and join us&#8230;</em></p>

	<h3>Legendary Conference Locale: Biltmore</h3>
	<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/" target="_blank"><img style="width:100%;" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/biltmore-square.jpg" class="imgshadow" alt="The Biltmore in Asheville, North Carolina" /></a>
	<p>Conference programming will take place on the grounds of America's largest private home&#8212;<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/" target="_blank">Biltmore</a>. The 250-room mansion, built by George W. Vanderbilt in 1895 and beautifully preserved and restored for visitors today, is only one part of the Biltmore experience, which also includes numerous gardens, trails and outdoor adventures on the 8,000-acre estate, shopping and dining at Antler Hill Village, and welcoming hospitality at the Inn on Biltmore Estate. Add to that a legacy of sustainable agricultural practices, America's most visited (and award-winning) winery, and the majestic vistas of the surrounding Blue Ridge Mountains, and it's easy to see why more than one million travelers choose to visit Biltmore each year.</p>
