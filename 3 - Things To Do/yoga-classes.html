<p>
Yoga may have originated in India, but Asheville is a haven for all the yogis and yoginis out there. Many people swear by yoga's various health benefits -- from increasing your flexibility, toning the muscles and massaging internal organs. And Asheville hasn't been slow to catch on as the area offers many dynamic and creative yoga classes at more than a dozen area yoga studios, gyms and health clubs.
</p>
<p>
Most studios and gyms offer drop-in options on their classes for a fee (prices range and are often on a sliding scale, but expect to pay about $15 a class). Typically, pregnant women, seniors, beginning students, or those with injuries need to start with a prenatal, gentle, introduction or Level One class, so check class schedules to find a class right for you. If you're an experienced practitioner, though, most studios and health clubs offer advanced classes or personalized instruction. Some also offer studio rentals for private practice.

<p>
With classes offered every day and geared to everyone from little kids and pregnant women to seniors and those with disabilities, there's sure to be a yoga class in Asheville for you. And whether you'd like to try yoga for the first time or want an intensive opportunity to detoxify and rejuvenate, yoga classes in Asheville can leave you relaxed and calm.
