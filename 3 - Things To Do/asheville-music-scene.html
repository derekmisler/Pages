<p class="intro">Asheville's music scene is a vital piece of the city's culture. The rhythm of the city began centuries ago with the arrival of Scotch-Irish settlers who filled the hills with the sounds of their reels, ballads and folk songs.</p>

<h3>From Bluegrass to Newgrass to Nograss</h3>
<p>A progressive and collaborative arts community, Asheville's modern music scene melds old and new with surprising ease. Music permeates the city from the street musicians who serenade you downtown, to multi-generation bluegrass jam sessions, to a rock club (<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Orange-Peel-Social-Aid-and-Pleasure-Club/315/default/">Orange Peel Social Aid and Pleasure Club</a>) named one of the best in the country by Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>Today, Asheville's music scene is all encompassing. Traditional mountain music still rings out from national artists such as David Holt and Laura Boosinger who live in the area. Classical music from the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Symphony-Orchestra-/311/default/">Asheville Symphony Orchestra</a> fills the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Thomas-Wolfe-Auditorium/55/default/">Thomas Wolfe Auditorium</a> throughout the year.</p>

	<h4>These Hills are Alive with the Sound of Appalachian Music</h4>
	<p>The instruments needed for distinct mountain sound have old world origins. The banjo hails from Africa and the fiddle has European roots. However, the only native instrument to the mountain region, is the Appalachian dulcimer. This instrument is considered to be one of the easiest to learn due to its small string count and simplified fret system. Want to find one for yourself? Visit the Grove Arcade in downtown Asheville where the <a href="http://thewoodrow.com/" target="_blank">Woodrow</a> stringed instruments are sold. If you travel to Black Mountain visit <a href="http://songofthewood.com/">Song of the Wood</a> to see a wide collection of mountain dulcimers for sale.</p>
