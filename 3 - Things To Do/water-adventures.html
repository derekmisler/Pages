<h2>Top Swimming Holes in Asheville</h2>
<p>When you want to learn about swimming holes, you go to the experts. The crew at Blue Ridge Outdoors Magazine (BRO), who get paid to mountain bike, raft, hike and paddle in places most of us don't even know exist, provide the following adventurer insider list of top swimming holes in Western North Carolina.</p>

			<h3>Best Swimming Hole for Laps</h3>
			<h5>Hooker Falls</h5>
			<ul class="big-numbers">
				<li><p>DuPont State Forest, Transylvania County, N.C.</p></li>
				<li><p>Bathing suits required? Yes.</p></li>
				<li><p>Family friendly? Yes.</p></li>
				<li><p>Safety considerations: Stay below the falls. It may not seem like much of a drop from the top, but that avalanche of water won't treat you kindly at the bottom.</p></li>
				<li><p>Though heavily trafficked in the summer months, the pool at the foot of Hooker Falls will never get too crowded for a swimmer who wants to combine a day in the forest with a good workout.</p></li>
				<li><p>Hooker Falls is the fourth falls on the Little River in DuPont State Forest, one of western North Carolina's new outdoor hot spots. It drops 11 feet into an Olympic-size swimming hole with a rocky, woodsy shoreline on both sides.</p></li>
				<li><p>A few laps from one side to the other will definitely help you meet your cardio quota for the day.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong class="bigger-strong">Directions</strong>: From the Hooker Falls parking lot in DuPont State Forest, located in southern Transylvania County, Hooker Falls itself is a five-minute walk down the dirt road past the gate. Stay left and follow the river. You can't miss it.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Best Swimming Hole for Tubing</h3>
			<h5>Davidson River</h5>
			<ul class="big-numbers">
				<li><p>Pisgah National Forest,&nbsp;Transylvania County, N.C.</p></li>
				<li><p>Bathing suits required? Yes.</p></li>
				<li><p>Family friendly? Yes.</p></li>
				<li><p>Safety considerations: The Davidson can be more powerful than it looks. Parents should keep a close eye on small children, especially in the small sections of rapids. Wear sandals or sneakers to protect your feet from sharp rocks. When close to the banks, watch out for overhanging twigs and branches. They have a thing for eyes.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong class="bigger-strong">Directions:</strong> The NC 276 entrance to Pisgah lies just east of Brevard. The tube man will give you directions to a number of different places to park along the river depending on how long you want to float for. Remember you'll need two cars: one at the start of your trip and one at the end. Sycamore Flats picnic area in Pisgah is the universal take-out spot for Davidson tubers.</p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div id="sunbathing" class="hide">
			<h3>Best Swimming Hole for Sunbathing</h3>
			<h5>South Toe River, N.C.</h5>
			<ul class="big-numbers">
				<li><p>Bathing suits required? Yes.</p></li>
				<li><p>Family friendly? Yes.</p></li>
				<li><p>Safety considerations: Though the river is relatively safe, it does feature some true rapids.</p></li>
				<li><p>Know your river safety rules before you jump in. Also, don't float past the bridge at the end of the campground.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong class="bigger-strong">Directions:</strong> From Burnsville, take U.S. 19-E for five miles. Turn right on NC 80 and travel nine miles.</p></li>
				<li><p>Unlike most mountain swimming holes, the South Toe's proximity to the campground means you'll have a place to change, set up your camp chairs, and spread out your picnic blanket without having to haul everything down a gully through tangled laurel slicks. Just park and play.</p></li>
				<li><p>Down by the deepest point of the river, true sun worshippers can spread out their towels on a concrete platform, though they might get splashed by jumpers. Or just hop in an inner tube and float down past the giant rocks. The light bouncing off the river will brown you on both sides.</p></li>

			<h2>Sliding Rock</h2>
			<p>In the Pisgah National Forest you'll find a <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Sliding-Rock-A-Natural-Water-Slide/284/default/">natural water slide</a>. This slippery rock forms a mountain waterslide in Transylvania County on U.S. 276 near Asheville. The 60-foot, flat, sloping boulder is a perfect launching pad for thousands of visitors every year. Fueled by 11,000 gallons of water pumped down the rock each minute, Sliding Rock is a perfect place for chlorine-free fun.</p>
			<p class="info">While you're in the area, check out <a href="#looking-glass">Looking Glass Falls</a>, also on U.S. 276. The 60-foot waterfall is stunning and the wading pool below is perfect for children.</p>

<h2>Whitewater Rafting near Asheville</h2>
<p>Asheville is the envy of many cities with its beautiful mountains and proximity to great rafting locations such as the French Broad River, Nantahala River and Nolichucky River. Outdoor magazine named Asheville the top whitewater destination in the U.S.</p>
<p>The French Broad River's long, peaceful stretches are ideal for calm water floats and family canoe trips, while its whitewater rapids can also be exciting for kayaks and canoe enthusiasts. The wide river winds through Pisgah National Forest mountainside, offering eight miles of small and large rapids, with occasional placid pools perfect for swimming.</p>
<p>The Nantahala River is ideal for families and beginners, but offers options for those with more experience. The river meanders through the beautiful Nantahala Gorge, and even the most inexperienced paddler will enjoy this beautiful river that is dam-controlled, making water releases regular and predictable.</p>
<p>Adventurous rafters can challenge the fast-moving Nolichucky River. Hemmed in by one of the steepest and most beautiful gorges in North Carolina, the river requires considerable maneuvering around rocks and boulders to get through its many rapids and pools as it runs through the Pisgah and Cherokee National Forests.</p>
<h4>What to bring</h4>
<p>You actually don't need to pack a lot of extra gear to include a whitewater trip in your vacation plans. Here's a basic list. And once you know which river guide company will be guiding your trip, contact them to find out if you'll need any specific items for your trip.</p>
<ul class="big-numbers">
	<li><p>A towel and change of clothes</p></li>
	<li><p>Sturdy shoes or river sandals</p></li>
	<li><p>A bathing suit and/or shorts and a T-shirt</p></li>
	<li><p>Sunscreen</p></li>
	<li><p>Waterproof cameras</p></li>
	<li><p>Sunglasses</p></li>

<h2>Waterfalls in the Asheville area</h2>
<img class="img-left imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/Waterfall-Romance.jpg" alt="A Couple at a Waterfall" />
<p>Many trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway lead to waterfalls, depending on the season and rainfall conditions. The Graveyard Fields Loop, found at Blue Ridge Parkway Milepost 419, allows easy access to a number of waterfalls flowing from Yellowstone Prong. The trails at Graveyard Fields are well mapped, but can become slippery in wet conditions. Nearby Transylvania County is home to 250 amazing waterfalls including Triple Falls, Looking Glass Falls (see below) and Toxaway Falls. Here are a few more favorite waterfalls in the region.</p>
<h3>Cullasaja Gorge</h3>
<img width="130" height="200" class="img-right imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/images/looking_glass_falls.jpg" alt="Looking Glass Falls" />
<p>
To experience some of the many breathtaking views, follow the Blue Ridge Parkway south from Asheville to N.C. 215. Take 215 south to U.S. 64 and continue west through Lake Toxaway, Sapphire, Cashiers and Highlands. Follow 64 through the colorful Cullasaja Gorge where numerous waterfalls - including Bridal Veil Falls, Dry Falls and majestic Cullasaja Falls - cascade close to the highway. In Franklin, turn north on U.S. Highway 441 and head to Dillsboro. From there, hop on U.S. Highway 23 and drive straight back to Asheville.
</p>
<h3>White Water Falls</h3>
<p>
The highest waterfall east of the Rockies, Upper Whitewater Falls drops 411. A trail along rugged terrain leads to the falls. Wildflowers abound throughout the year. Take 240-West to I-26-West. Go to the Asheville Airport/Brevard Exit (exit 40) and take a right onto 280 and follow it toward Brevard. Drive west on U.S. 64. At Sapphire, turn left on NC 281 and go south to the Whitewater Falls entrance.
</p>
<h3 id="looking-glass">Looking Glass Falls &amp; the Pisgah National Forest</h3>
<img class="img-right imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/WNCWaterfall.jpg" alt="WNC Waterfall" />
<p>
The Blue Ridge Parkway is also a connection point to a scenic loop that meanders through a part of the Pisgah National Forest once owned by George Vanderbilt. From Asheville, take the Blue Ridge Parkway south and exit onto Highway 276 at milepost 412. On this drive you will pass the Cradle of Forestry, which is a great place to stop and learn more about the birth of forestry in America, and several hiking trails are available on the property. Look for the trailhead on the left past the Cradle of Forestry to take a short hike to Moore's Cove Falls or continue south on Hwy 276 where you can park and walk down stairs to see the breathtaking beauty of the 85-foot Looking Glass Falls. Sliding Rock is also along this stretch of scenic road. You may want to stop for lunch at one of the many scenic picnic spots. The Pisgah Ranger Station, located further down Hwy 276, can provide more information on activities in the area. Continue on 276 until you reach Highway 280. Follow 280 east back to Asheville. Exit to I-26 back into town.
</p>
<h3>Linville Falls</h3>
<p>
Located at milepost 316.3 on the Blue Ridge Parkway, north of where US 221 crosses the Parkway and south of where NC 181 crosses the Parkway, this series of falls are along the Linville River as it cuts through a steep gorge. An easy trail to the upper and lower falls starts from the Visitor Center.
</p>
<h3>Crabtree Falls</h3>
<img class="img-right imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/images/waterfall_couple.jpg" alt="Waterfall Couple" />
<p>
The trail to Crabtree Falls begins in the Crabtree Meadows picnic area located at mile post 339.5 along the Blue Ridge Parkway.   A steep descent nearly one mile down the mountain takes you to the base of the falls where you can view the 100 foot drop of the Toe River.
</p>
<h3>Hickory Nut Falls at Chimney Rock</h3>
<p>
A .75-mile trail offers a leisurely walk through hardwood forests of oak, hickory, maple and basswood harboring abundant plant life, including rare and endangered wildflowers and old favorites such as Jack-in-the-pulpit and Solomon's-seal. The reward is 404ft Hickory Nut Falls, one of the tallest waterfalls east of the Mississippi. Dainty white blossoms of Lady rue and grassy fronds of Deerhair bulrush thrive in the waterfall's mist. Deerhair bulrush is a grass-like plant with small knobs at the end of shiny, wiry leaves, found growing out of the cracks along the rock and cliff wall near Hickory Nut Falls.
