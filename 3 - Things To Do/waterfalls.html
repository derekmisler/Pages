Many trails along the Blue Ridge Parkway lead to waterfalls, depending on the season and rainfall conditions. The Graveyard Fields Loop, found at Blue Ridge Parkway Milepost 419, allows easy access to a number of waterfalls flowing from Yellowstone Prong. The trails at Graveyard Fields are well mapped, but can become slippery in wet conditions. Nearby Transylvania County is home to 250 amazing waterfalls including Triple Falls, Looking Glass Falls (see below) and Toxaway Falls. Here are a few more favorite waterfalls in the region.

To experience some of the many breathtaking views, follow the Blue Ridge Parkway south from Asheville to N.C. 215. Take 215 south to U.S. 64 and continue west through Lake Toxaway, Sapphire, Cashiers and Highlands. Follow 64 through the colorful Cullasaja Gorge where numerous waterfalls - including Bridal Veil Falls, Dry Falls and majestic Cullasaja Falls - cascade close to the highway. In Franklin, turn north on U.S. Highway 441 and head to Dillsboro. From there, hop on U.S. Highway 23 and drive straight back to Asheville.

<p>
The Blue Ridge Parkway is also a connection point to a scenic loop that meanders through a part of the Pisgah National Forest once owned by George Vanderbilt. From Asheville, take the Blue Ridge Parkway south and exit onto Highway 276 at milepost 412. On this drive you will pass the Cradle of Forestry, which is a great place to stop and learn more about the birth of forestry in America, and several hiking trails are available on the property. Look for the trailhead on the left past the Cradle of Forestry to take a short hike to Moore's Cove Falls or continue south on Hwy 276 where you can park and walk down stairs to see the breathtaking beauty of the 85-foot Looking Glass Falls. Sliding Rock is also along this stretch of scenic road. You may want to stop for lunch at one of the many scenic picnic spots. The Pisgah Ranger Station, located further down Hwy 276, can provide more information on activities in the area. Continue on 276 until you reach Highway 280. Follow 280 east back to Asheville. Exit to I-26 back into town.

<h3>Linville Falls</h3>
<p>
Located at milepost 316.3 on the Blue Ridge Parkway, north of where US 221 crosses the Parkway and south of where NC 181 crosses the Parkway, this series of falls are along the Linville River as it cuts through a steep gorge. An easy trail to the upper and lower falls starts from the Visitor Center.

<h3>Crabtree Falls</h3>

<p>
The trail to Crabtree Falls begins in the Crabtree Meadows picnic area located at mile post 339.5 along the Blue Ridge Parkway.   A steep descent nearly one mile down the mountain takes you to the base of the falls where you can view the 100 foot drop of the Toe River.
</p>
<h3>Hickory Nut Falls at Chimney Rock</h3>
<p>
A .75-mile trail offers a leisurely walk through hardwood forests of oak, hickory, maple and basswood harboring abundant plant life, including rare and endangered wildflowers and old favorites such as Jack-in-the-pulpit and Solomon's-seal. The reward is 404ft Hickory Nut Falls, one of the tallest waterfalls east of the Mississippi. Dainty white blossoms of Lady rue and grassy fronds of Deerhair bulrush thrive in the waterfall's mist. Deerhair bulrush is a grass-like plant with small knobs at the end of shiny, wiry leaves, found growing out of the cracks along the rock and cliff wall near Hickory Nut Falls.
