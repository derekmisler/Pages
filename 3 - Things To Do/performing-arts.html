<h2>Asheville draws headliners from around the world</h2>
<p>Area clubs and concert halls are as distinctive and quirky as the bands that perform in them. You will find what you are looking for whether you're interested in seeing Blondie at The Orange Peel, The Bottle Rockets at The Grey Eagle, or the Western North Carolina Jazz Society's presentation of Johnny O'Neal Trio at the Diana Wortham Theatre at Pack Place.</p>
<p>When winter dusts the region with snow, the season heats up with the Warren Haynes Christmas Jam. Haynes has a special place in his heart for Asheville. Check out the Grove Park Inn &amp; Spa's &quot;All that Jazz&quot; series in January, which has featured legends like Dave Brubeck.</p>
