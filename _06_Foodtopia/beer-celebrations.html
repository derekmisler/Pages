	<p>There&rsquo;s plenty to be celebrated in Beer City USA, and Asheville certainly rolls out the red carpet for its favorite brews. From the musically inclined Brewgrass Festival, to the specialty-focused Best Firkin Beer Festival, the parties are as unique as the breweries themselves.</p>
	<p>Festivals are a great way to introduce yourself to a variety of beers and to pick out that one ale, lager, stout or porter that will keep you coming back for another pour. And Asheville isn&rsquo;t afraid to share the love&mdash;festivals welcome regional brewers from across North Carolina and the Southeast.</p>
