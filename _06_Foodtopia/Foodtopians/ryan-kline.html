<p>In 2009, when 21-year-old Ryan Kline moved from Pennsylvania to Asheville to begin his career as a chef, he thought his parents were too far away to pry. But Kline arrived during a culinary boom, and national media outlets regularly feature Asheville restaurants, so his folks keep up with him.</p>

<p>On a recent Food Network special, Kline cooked dinner with celebrity chef Justin Warner. &ldquo;My parents were watching that night, and my dad called me and said, &lsquo;I saw you drinking a beer by the hog pit,&rsquo;&rdquo; Kline recalls with a chuckle. &ldquo;My parents are very much on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kline, now 26, is head chef at Buffalo Nickel, which opened in a historic building in West Asheville in March of 2014. In the polished, two-story restaurant, bar and game room, he serves modern American favorites, such as grilled rib-eye with roasted vegetables and chicken pot pie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can come in here and have a nice dinner and then go upstairs and hang out some more, have some drinks and cocktails at the bar, shoot a game of pool,&rdquo; Kline says. &ldquo;You could have a really nice date night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kline credits his youthful success to the inspiring community of local chefs. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a very tight-knit group of restaurant people,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in this together; you can&rsquo;t eat at one person&rsquo;s restaurant every night of the week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That camaraderie is great for chefs and diners, Kline explains. &ldquo;It keeps us all pushing to do better,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all looking at each other&rsquo;s menus and trying to one-up each other. Friendly competition breeds a better experience for everybody.&rdquo;</p>
