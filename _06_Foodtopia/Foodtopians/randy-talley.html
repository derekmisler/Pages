By Randy Talley&rsquo;s estimation, Asheville consumes more natural food per capita than anywhere else, but just 22 years ago, this situation seemed impossible.

<p>
Talley, owner of Green Sage Cafe, came to Asheville in 1992 to research the potential for a natural foods supermarket, Earth Fare. His team hired a renowned analyst to look for prospective customers; he couldn&rsquo;t find any.

The analyst told Talley not to despair. &ldquo;He said some market characteristics are so rare they only exist in one place,&rdquo; Talley recalls. &ldquo;Perhaps Asheville has its own psyche, a rare psyche, so it can&rsquo;t be compared to other markets.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Two decades later, Talley knows Asheville has that rare psyche and a hunger for healthy eats. The city boasts six natural groceries and three locations of Talley&rsquo;s Green Sage Cafe, which serves nourishing meals in a casual, inviting atmosphere. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to be very good at the simplest things,&rdquo; Talley says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to be the comfortable place.&rdquo;

Locals flock to Green Sage Cafe for its raw Citrus Kale Salad, its Miso Ginger Rice Bowl, and its fairer-than-fair trade Thrive Farmers Coffee. Most of the menu is easily modified for vegetarians and sensitive eaters. &ldquo;Green Sage Cafe is a place where someone who has dietary restrictions can take their friends,&rdquo; Talley says. &ldquo;He can get his burger, and she can get a gluten-free vegan burger.&rdquo;

A meal at the cafe is also a way to support environmentally friendly innovations; see the rooftop solar panels, and add your scraps to the compost bin. Talley knows sustainability is important to Asheville diners, and he provides a restaurant that supports their values.
