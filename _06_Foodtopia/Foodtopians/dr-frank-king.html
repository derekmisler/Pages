<p>The Watusi isn&#39;t just a 1960s dance; it&#39;s the name of a cattle breed with horns among the largest in the world. At his farm in Leicester, Dr. Frank King raises about 200 Watusi, along with a menagerie of camels, bison, yak, elk and more--all in the name of curiosity and nutritional research.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re all about education,&quot; King says. &quot;We want to help people make good food choices that make a difference in their health.&quot; King&#39;s Carolina Bison specializes in lean, flavorful bison meat, selling it as steaks, roasts and sausages.</p>

<p>A chiropractic and naturopathic doctor, King prizes the meat for its health benefits and links it to longevity. &quot;Bison is the real American red meat,&quot; he says, explaining that it was a crucial part of the Native American diet.</p>

<p>So what about the Watusi? King keeps the herd for research. He&#39;s interested in the nutritional benefits of different milks and meats. He promotes genetic diversity among species, so he gathers animals from all over the world for breeding. As a result, he&#39;s created an impressive display of rarities, such as white bison. The farm is open for tours, and King is working on expanding the attractions to include a train ride.</p>

<p>In addition to Carolina Bison, King operates King Bio, which creates and sells natural remedies nationwide. Major drug stores and grocery chains stock his products under labels such as Dr. King&#39;s Natural Medicine, Safecare, and Natural Pet.</p>

<p>When asked why Pennsylvania-born King settled in Asheville, he replied, &quot;It was a gut feeling. We just had this inner peace and love for the place.&quot;</p>
