Jeff Miller is not the forestry professional he expected to become while studying at the University of Iowa. A passion for food pulled him away from his textbooks. &quot;There was definitely a calling to the stove,&quot; he says. &quot;Instead of going to class and doing my homework, I was cooking and in the bookstores reading about food.&quot;

Today, he owns Luella's Bar-B-Que with his wife, Ashley Miller, where he serves a range of styles. He discovered many of them while roaming the country with his kitchen comrades who worked with him at big-city restaurants. &quot;We were cooking high end food all day long, but we'd get days off and just go driving around the country looking for barbecue,&quot; Miller says. &quot;That's when I got a taste for real Southern barbecue and Carolina barbecue at that.&quot;

His explorations resulted in a menu that pulls from many regional styles, inspired by eastern Carolina, Texas and Memphis. &quot;The food is updated for today's audience,&quot; Miller says. &quot;Asheville has attracted people from all different areas, so my barbecue reflects that.&quot;

He loves the down-home, flavorful food for its universal appeal. &quot;It transcends classes,&quot; he says. &quot;You could have barbecue at the governor's mansion or in the park with your friends.&quot;

Does that mission sound thoughtful for a casual restaurant? Don't be surprised to find that depth of consideration all over town, Miller says. &quot;There seems to be a fever pitch for the best way to do things, a higher standard, whether it's in hospitality or the quality of food,&quot; he explains. &quot;The bar for dining experiences is constantly raising in Asheville, and I don't see an end to that.&quot;
