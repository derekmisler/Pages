Meherwan Irani sees himself as a storyteller as much as a restaurateur. Chai Pani, his Indian street food cafe, tells a story of spice markets, hawkers, rickshaws and streetside chefs through smell, flavor, color and taste.

&ldquo;Indian food seems like an exotic cuisine for most people,&rdquo; says Irani, who grew up in India before moving to San Francisco to get an MBA. &ldquo;I felt like if people connected with the story of the food and where it came from, that would make the food much more approachable.&rdquo;

As a result, Asheville craves dishes rarely found outside of India, such as uttapam (Indian crepes) and bhel puri, a bed of rice puffs, chickpea noodles and potatoes topped with yogurt and tamarind and green chutneys. The restaurant has been so popular that Irani recently opened a cocktail lounge based on similar flavors, MG Road.

Irani says a ready audience helps his task. &ldquo;Asheville embraces stories,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Stop anybody in the street and ask them how they got here; it&rsquo;s always an amazing story. It just seems to be that kind of city.&rdquo;

The tale proves equally enchanting outside of Asheville. Irani launched a second Chai Pani in Decatur, Georgia, and he&rsquo;s working on a stall in Atlanta&rsquo;s Ponce City Market. He also received a James Beard Award nomination. As a result, the Atlanta media has tried to claim him, but Irani remains a proud resident of Asheville. &ldquo;What if we did what we really wanted to do?&rdquo; he recalls asking his wife. &ldquo;I honestly believe because we were in Asheville, we were able to answer that question, and Chai Pani was born.&rdquo;
