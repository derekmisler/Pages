Chris Reedy understands the thrill of branching out and trying something new. Over the course of his career, he's earned an MBA, worked as a youth advocate, operated an eastern imports business, worked for a building contractor and studied hops. Now, as executive director of Asheville's food incubator, Blue Ridge Food Ventures, he helps other people convert inspiration into new products.

&quot;The food incubator grew out of the agricultural movement here,&quot; Reedy explains. &quot;Because of the mountains, we don't have the land for huge commodity farms, so instead, people do whatever they can to add value to their products.&quot;

Since Blue Ridge Food Ventures opened in 2004, it's helped 250 small businesses produce $10 million worth of goods-jams, salsas, snacks, chocolates, soaps and more. Local grocery store shelves brimming with Asheville products testify to the success of the incubator. If you're looking for a souvenir, Reedy recommends Lusty Monk Mustard, UliMana Chocolate, and Smiling Hara Tempeh-just a sampling of what's made at the kitchen.

It takes courage to start a small business, Reedy says, but Asheville has historically attracted innovators. &quot;People have always been creative here-Black Mountain College, Buckminster Fuller, Edwin Grove,&quot; he explains. &quot;Entrepreneurship is big, and the community challenges you to be creative and supports you as you work toward whatever success means to you.&quot;

As Asheville's restaurant scene captures national attention, local products help chefs show off fine mountain flavors, Reedy explains. &quot;Our clients add another dimension to the food scene,&quot; he says. &quot;You can have an uber-local dining experience here, from the condiments to the main course. There's not many places that you can do that.&quot;
