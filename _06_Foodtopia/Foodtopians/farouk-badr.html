<p><a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Jerusalem-Garden-Cafe/360/default/"></a>Farouk Badr will tell you he leaves cooking to the chefs at his restaurant, Jerusalem Garden. But his staff laughs and says he's being modest; he's in the kitchen everyday perfecting recipes for the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern menu, many of which he inherited from his family in Jordan.</p>

<p>Right now, Badr's passion is for a seemingly simple staple. &quot;I'm trying to perfect the pocket pita, but it's not easy to do,&quot; he says. &quot;If I get it right, it's a reward for me. It's motivation always to be more successful.&quot;</p>

<p>Badr's drive to create from-scratch recipes for most everything on the menu has resulted in fresh hummus with rich flavor, handmade stuffed grape leaves, and tender, sliced lamb, roasted in house.</p>

<p>The decor reflects a similar motivation to excel. In an incredible effort, Badr imported a colorful Egyptian tent and hung it from the ceiling in one of the dining rooms. The spacious structure feels like a desert camp for a king. &quot;I wanted to make it different,&quot; Badr says. &quot;Even though the tent is foreign, it's like art-most of us appreciate the same things.&quot;</p>

<p>When the restaurant opened in 1993, it was one of the few eateries that sold foreign food. Over the years, diners embraced the new flavors, and Jerusalem Garden expanded from a sandwich shop to a full-service concept. Throughout downtown, global cuisine flourished, and Asheville now boasts Thai, Spanish, Indian, Japanese, Korean and Mexican restaurants.</p>

<p>For Badr, his clientele's curiosity about food creates a certain magic. &quot;The mosaic of people, it's beautiful,&quot; he says. &quot;Asheville is a masterpiece, and the people here add to that masterpiece.&quot;</p>
