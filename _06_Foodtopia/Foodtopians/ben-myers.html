Just south of downtown, local entrepreneurs have transformed a former manufacturing district into a center for local beer and sweets. In 2014, Vortex Doughnuts opened near a chocolate factory and several breweries in the up-and-coming neighborhood known as South Slope.

&quot;We are joining a great neighborhood of artisan producers,&quot; says Vortex owner Ben Myers. &quot;We strive to create something that is authentic, unique, and delicious-a doughnut as unique as Asheville.&quot;

Vortex serves doughnuts that are tasty, local, and twisted-in fact, those three words comprise its motto. Accordingly, the bakers create inventive glaze flavors such as lavender-Earl Grey and juniper-honey, plus classics such as chocolate, raspberry and coconut.

The menu proves that confections aren't just for kids with adult flavors such as cardamom-anise and beer. &quot;We use select beers from our neighborhood breweries to create a beer glaze, which we then cover in beer malt, peanuts and pretzels&quot; Myers says. &quot;It pretty much tastes like a soft Snickers bar for lack of more eloquent comparison.&quot;

The doughnut varieties change with the day - that's part of Vortex's philosophy, Myers explains. &quot;We are constantly playing with different flavor combinations to bring energy and excitement to our offerings,&quot; he says. &quot;These shift seasonally to mirror changes in the fields, mountains and farmers markets.&quot;

Vortex is equally focused on invention and integrity, so Myers works to source ingredients that are GMO-free, and he partners with nearby producers of soda, milk, beer and more. This effort creates delicious doughnuts, but it's also about building a thriving local food scene. &quot;Little choices add up,&quot; Myers says. &quot;We treat people and nature well, and we're willing to take time to grow.&quot;
