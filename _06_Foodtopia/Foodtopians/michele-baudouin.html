<p>When you see French chef Michel Baudouin, ask him his nickname for Asheville. Neither the content of his answer nor its charmingly accented delivery disappoints. &ldquo;I call it Funky Town because it&rsquo;s got a lot of character,&rdquo; Baudouin says. &ldquo;The businesses are very, very diversified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Baudouin heads up the French quarter of Funky Town with two restaurants, Bouchon Bistro and Creperie Bouchon. &ldquo;We try to offer diners a quick trip to France,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;When people go out, they want more than just food; they want an experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the Creperie, that experience couples casual fare with live music in a hidden courtyard. At Bouchon, it revolves around comforting bistro fare &mdash; Bouillabaisse, steak au poivre, beef bourguignon &mdash; and fine wine. Both restaurants offer popular all-you-can-eat mussel nights Monday through Wednesday. (The record is about 350 mussels and their accompanying herbed fries.)</p>

<p>Baudouin says his restaurants benefit from a combination of fun food (no nouveau cuisine here) and unusual architecture.&ldquo;The layout we&rsquo;re in &mdash; the old buildings, this courtyard that nobody can see from the street &mdash; just landed itself,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It reminds me of a little square in any French town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tiny Creperie&rsquo;s street number makes most people laugh: 62&frac12;. Baudouin attributes its quirky architecture to Asheville&rsquo;s slow recovery from the Great Depression. The city spent decades (until 1976) repaying its debts, and downtown became a time capsule from the 1920s. &ldquo;When there is no money to build, there is no money to demolish, and that&rsquo;s why the town has kept a lot of its old charms,&rdquo; Baudouin says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes it interesting.&rdquo;</p>
