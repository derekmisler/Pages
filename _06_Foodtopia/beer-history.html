	<h2>The Evolution of a Beer Town</h2>
	<p>Asheville’s beer culture all started back in 1994, when Oscar Wong, a retired engineer living in Charlotte, moved to Asheville and opened <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Highland-Brewing-Company/191/default/">Highland Brewing Company</a> in a rustic basement space below <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Barley-s-Taproom-Pizzeria/478/default/">Barley’s Taproom and Pizzeria</a> in downtown Asheville.</p>
	<p>What began as a home-brew hobby became the first successful brewery operation in Asheville landing Wong his status as godfather of “<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/grand-rapids-asheville-share-beercity-usa-2012-title" target="_blank">Beer City USA.</a>” Since then, Asheville has seen more than a dozen breweries of all sizes and styles open their doors. Asheville offers everything from tiny nanobreweries adjacent to taprooms, to a tasting bar offering exclusively wild and sour beers, and from outdoor patios where everyone feels like a local, to a “mostly organic” operation that sources local flavors like coffee and pumpkin&mdash;plus everything in between.</p>
	<p>Today the craft beer scene in Asheville has reached a fever pitch with <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/beer-scene/#celebrations">several annual beer festivals</a>, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Brews-Cruise/314/default/">brewery tours</a> by foot, car or mega-bike, and every kind of sweet treat <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/beer-scene/#beerinwhat">infused with craft brew goodness</a>.</p>
	<p>Asheville is <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/05/asheville-wins-again.html" target="_blank">four-time winner</a> of the annual Beer City USA poll, hosted by Charlie Papazian with Examiner.com. This designation helped put Asheville’s beer scene on the map and garnered the attention of <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/01/sierra-nevada-is-asheville-bound.html" target="_blank">Sierra Nevada</a> and <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/04/new-belgium-brewing-ashevilles-newest.html" target="_blank">New Belgium Brewing</a>, both of whom are establishing East Coast homes in the area.</p>
	<p>And the local brews themselves are making quite a splash. In 2013, brew scene newcomer <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Wicked-Weed-Brewing/4268/default/">Wicked Weed</a> brought home a gold medal from the Great American Beer Festival, and <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Brewing-Company/414/default/">Asheville Brewing Company’s</a> longtime favorite Ninja Porter won its category in 2014. Many other Asheville breweries have collected medals and accolades at competition across the U.S.</p>
