Nothing beats the white noise of a waterfall for a quiet moment to reconnect and rejuvenate. Surrounded by more than 800,000 acres of pristine wilderness, 2,000 miles of hiking/biking trails and world-class whitewater, Asheville is an oasis for health-conscious, active vacationers who want to come home more fit, relaxed and healthy than when they left. A destination for rejuvenation since the 1800s, Asheville has drawn the likes of George W. Vanderbilt and&nbsp;F. Scott Fitzgerald for the healing properties of the mountain air and nearby natural hot springs.
