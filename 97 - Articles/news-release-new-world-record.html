<p>With 2,180 miles stretching across 14 states, a thru-hike on the Appalachian Trail is daunting for anyone to attempt. For Asheville resident Jennifer Pharr Davis it was a calling. However that calling wasn't just to hike the entire trail, but to break the record for speed set in 2005, and that's just what she did. To top it off she surpassed not only the women's record, but the men's as well.</p>
<p>Logging in over 40-50+ miles per day, Davis completed the trail in 46 days, 11 hours and 20 minutes breaking the previous record set by Andrew Thomas by one day, two hours and 11 minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My previous hike in 2008 taught me that setting a record  wasn&rsquo;t about being fast or strong. It is all about fortitude, intelligence and perseverance.  The fact that women give birth and live longer than guys makes me think that we  might even have an evolutionary edge,&rdquo; Davis said regarding her ambition to  break the overall record.</p>
<p>Along the way Davis weathered shin splints, thunderstorms  and had multiple wildlife sightings such as moose, bears and grouse. Her &ldquo;pit  crew&rdquo; included a number of friends and her husband Brew, all of which cheered  her on along the way, met her at trail crossings to provide supplies and some  even hiked long stretches to provide company.</p>
<p>Davisâ€™ husband chronicled each day of the journey on her <a href="http://jenniferpharrdavis.tumblr.com/" title="Opens in a new window." target="_blank">blog</a> so that people could  follow the adventure. Davis is also the author of <em>Becoming Odyssa: Adventures on the Appalachian Trail</em> that details  her previous journey down the AT.</p>
