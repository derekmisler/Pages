<p>In Asheville, every day offers a reason to gather around our table and celebrate. Asheville's culinary festivals and food-filled street fairs are year-round and celebrate everything from ramps to local honey to hand-crafted beers.</p>
<p>Sip your way through a food and wine festival or taste how the local food movement is taking "fair food" to new heights. Most of our food events also incorporate other Southern Appalachian traditions such as bluegrass music, mountain crafts and farm life demonstrations. So, put on your sneakers, grab your forks, and join the feast.</p>
