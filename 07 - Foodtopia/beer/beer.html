<h2>Welcome to Beer City, USA</h2>
<p>Asheville has long been famous for its stunning scenery, lively mountain music and famous attractions such as <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/">Biltmore</a> and the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Blue-Ridge-Parkway/205/default/">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>. And now, Asheville has become the craft-brewing center of the Southeast. <strong>Asheville beer</strong> has garnered so much enthusiasm that it was named the winner of the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/grand-rapids-asheville-share-beercity-usa-2012-title" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Examiner's &#8220;<strong>Beer City, USA</strong>&#8221; poll</a> four years running.</p>
<p>Boasting more <a href="#beerhistory">breweries per capita</a> than any U.S. city (roughly one brewery per 4,100 people), the Asheville area is home to 21 craft breweries. On any given day, roughly 100 local beers can be enjoyed in Asheville, served on draft and in bottles. Each of our breweries has its own unique atmosphere and personality and the same could be said for the beer. Learn more about <strong>Asheville beer</strong> below.</p>

		</p></li>
		<li>Move &amp; Booze
			<p>Also known for an active outdoor scene, it’s no wonder that Asheville offers beer tastings for folks on the move. Grab some buddies and pedal your way around Asheville on the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Amazing-Pubcycle/5595/default/">Amazing Pubcycle</a>&mdash;part touring trolley, part bike, part party bus. Or slow down with a Bend &amp; Brew class, offering 45 minutes of all-levels yoga followed by a refreshing tasting.

Schedule a hops tour with <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Hop-n-Blueberry-Farm/3683/default/">Hop N Blueberry</a> or <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Echoview-Farm/3862/default/">Echoview</a> farms to learn more about the beer making process.

	<h2>Hopping Brewing Scene</h2>
	<h4>The Evolution of a Beer Town</h4>
	<p>Asheville’s beer culture all started back in 1994, when Oscar Wong, a retired engineer living in Charlotte, moved to Asheville and opened <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Highland-Brewing-Company/191/default/">Highland Brewing Company</a> in a rustic basement space below <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Barley-s-Taproom-Pizzeria/478/default/">Barley’s Taproom and Pizzeria</a> in downtown Asheville.</p>
	<p>What began as a home-brew hobby became the first successful brewery operation in Asheville landing Wong his status as godfather of “<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/grand-rapids-asheville-share-beercity-usa-2012-title" target="_blank">Beer City USA.</a>” Since then, Asheville has seen more than a dozen breweries of all sizes and styles open their doors. Asheville offers everything from tiny nanobreweries adjacent to taprooms, to a tasting bar offering exclusively wild and sour beers, and from outdoor patios where everyone feels like a local, to a “mostly organic” operation that sources local flavors like coffee and pumpkin&mdash;plus everything in between.</p>
	<p>Today the craft beer scene in Asheville has reached a fever pitch with <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/beer-scene/#celebrations">several annual beer festivals</a>, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Brews-Cruise/314/default/">brewery tours</a> by foot, car or mega-bike, and every kind of sweet treat <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/beer-scene/#beerinwhat">infused with craft brew goodness</a>.</p>
	<p>Asheville is <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/05/asheville-wins-again.html" target="_blank">four-time winner</a> of the annual Beer City USA poll, hosted by Charlie Papazian with Examiner.com. This designation helped put Asheville’s beer scene on the map and garnered the attention of <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/01/sierra-nevada-is-asheville-bound.html" target="_blank">Sierra Nevada</a> and <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/04/new-belgium-brewing-ashevilles-newest.html" target="_blank">New Belgium Brewing</a>, both of whom are establishing East Coast homes in the area.</p>
	<p>And the local brews themselves are making quite a splash. In 2013, brew scene newcomer <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Wicked-Weed-Brewing/4268/default/">Wicked Weed</a> brought home a gold medal from the Great American Beer Festival, and <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Brewing-Company/414/default/">Asheville Brewing Company’s</a> longtime favorite Ninja Porter won its category in 2014. Many other Asheville breweries have collected medals and accolades at competition across the U.S.</p>
