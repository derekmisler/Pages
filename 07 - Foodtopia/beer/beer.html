<h2>Welcome to Beer City, USA</h2>
<p>
Asheville has long been famous for its stunning scenery, lively mountain music and famous attractions such as <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Biltmore/80/default/">Biltmore</a> and the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Blue-Ridge-Parkway/205/default/">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>. And now, Asheville has become the craft-brewing center of the Southeast. <strong>Asheville beer</strong> has garnered so much enthusiasm that it was named the winner of the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/grand-rapids-asheville-share-beercity-usa-2012-title" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Examiner's &#8220;<strong>Beer City, USA</strong>&#8221; poll</a> four years running.
</p>
<p>
Boasting more <a href="#beerhistory">breweries per capita</a> than any U.S. city (roughly one brewery per 8,000 people), Asheville is home to 20 craft breweries. On any given day, about 50 local beers can be enjoyed in Asheville, served on draft and in bottles. Each of our breweries has its own unique atmosphere and personality and the same could be said for the beer. Learn more about <strong>Asheville beer</strong> below.

And Asheville isn&rsquo;t afraid to share the loveâfestivals welcome regional brewers from across North Carolina and the Southeast.</p>

	<h2>Hopping Brewing Scene</h2>
	<h4>The Evolution of a Beer Town</h4>
	<p>Asheville&rsquo;s beer culture all started back in 1994, when Oscar Wong, a retired engineer living in Charlotte, moved to Asheville and opened <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Highland-Brewing-Company/191/default/">Highland Brewing Company</a> in a rustic basement space below <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Barley-s-Taproom-Pizzeria/478/default/">Barley&rsquo;s Taproom and Pizzeria</a> in downtown Asheville.</p>
	<p>What began as a home-brew hobby became the first successful brewery operation in Asheville landing Wong his status as godfather of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/grand-rapids-asheville-share-beercity-usa-2012-title" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank">Beer City USA</a>.&rdquo; Since then, Asheville has seen a number of breweries open their doors.</p>
	<p>Today the craft beer scene in Asheville has reached a fever pitch with <a href="#celebrations">four annual beer festivals</a>, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Brews-Cruise/314/default/">brewery tours</a> and even a popular ice cream made with Highland&rsquo;s rich black mocha stout.</p>
	<p>Asheville is <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/05/asheville-wins-again.html" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank">four-time winner</a> of the annual Beer City USA poll, hosted by Charlie Papazian with Examiner.com. This designation helped put Asheville&rsquo;s beer scene on the map and garnered the attention of <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/01/sierra-nevada-is-asheville-bound.html" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank">Sierra Nevada</a> and <a href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/04/new-belgium-brewing-ashevilles-newest.html" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank">New Belgium Brewing</a>. Both have announced plans to make the Asheville area their new east coast homes.</p>
