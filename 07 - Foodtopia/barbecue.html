<p>North Carolinians have been making great barbecue for hundreds of years. But before you place your order, there are a few things you need to know about North Carolina&rsquo;s favorite food.</p>
<h4>Any way you spell it, Barbecue still&nbsp;tastes&nbsp;good</h4>
<p>There are about as many ways to spell barbecue as there are people who eat it. Although &ldquo;barbecue&rdquo; has become fairly standard, you&rsquo;ll also find it spelled &ldquo;barbeque,&rdquo; &ldquo;bar-be-que, &ldquo;bar-b-cue,&rdquo; and abbreviated &ldquo;BBQ,&rdquo; as well as variations of those spellings.</p>
<h4>Ordering Barbecue</h4>
<p>Although &ldquo;barbecue&rdquo; can refer to any meat roasted slowly over coals, in North Carolina barbecue means pork. You&rsquo;ll usually find chicken or maybe beef on the menu, but if you just say &ldquo;barbecue,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re going to get pork.</p>
<h4>East Versus West North Carolina Barbecue</h4>
<p>In North Carolina, there are two completely different schools when it comes to barbecue: Eastern style and Western style.</p>
<p>In Eastern North Carolina, from Raleigh to the coast, barbecue means a whole hog cooked over the coals and served with a spicy sauce made from vinegar and red pepper pods. In the Piedmont and Western North Carolina mountains, Western style barbecue is king. Western style is pork shoulder, slow-cooked and served with a thin, slightly sweet tomato-based sauce.</p>

<h4>No matter how you slice it (or pull it, or chop it&#8230;)</h4>
<p>You&rsquo;ll often hear people talking about &ldquo;pulled pork&rdquo; barbecue. This is one of several methods for serving barbecue. &ldquo;Pulled&rdquo; means that the meat has been pulled off, allowing it to follow the natural striations of the meat. This gives the most tender barbecue. Other ways to enjoy barbecued pork are sliced, chopped or minced.</p>
