<h2>Local food tastes better</h2>
<img class="img-right imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/images/farmers_market.jpg" />
<p>There are many reasons to buy local, but the best reason is flavor. Food that doesn't travel as far is fresher.</p>
<p>Asheville is home to over 17 local tailgate markets, all selling farm-fresh produce and artisan goods. Artists, bakers, cheese makers and more converge each week to provide the best in locally made products.</p>
<h3>Local Farming</h3>
<p>Small local farms are more likely to use sustainable farming practices and to grow a wider variety of crops. The heirloom seeds that your neighboring farmer grows will remind you what tomatoes (or green beans, potatoes, peppers, etc) used to taste like. They will also remind you that there is more than one kind of each, as local farms grow vegetables that are unique and inspirational to cook with.</p>
