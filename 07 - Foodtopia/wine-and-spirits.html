<p>Wine and craft cocktails an extremely personal pastime, drawing from the background, culture, and habits of each person making the drinks.</p>
<p>When it comes to wine, typically you want to drink light-to-dark, just as when you plan a meal you start with delicate tastes and work towards heavier tastes.</p>
<h3>Here are a few wine pairing suggestions:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Champagne tends to go very well with appetizers or opening courses in a meal.</li>
	<li>White wine is usually a match for salads and lighter dishes.</li>
	<li>Red wine works perfectly with steaks and heavier meat sauces.</li>
	<li>A port is often the perfect end to a meal, sipped with a piece of chocolate cake.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, it comes down to what an individual enjoys, and what combination works best for that person. Every person's sense of taste is different. Decide for yourself what combinations of wine and food taste good to you.</p>
