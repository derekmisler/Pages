<h2>Mountain Food Legacies &amp; Harvest Adventures</h2>

<p class="intro">From hand-tied fishing lures to moonshine lore, Appalachia embodies a colorful culture&nbsp;all&nbsp;its&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>The Blue Ridge Mountains, the spine of southernmost Appalachia, are gently rolling as ranges go. Some of the oldest mountains in the world, the Blue Ridge and its famous scenic parkway are a source of much of the region's beauty, character&#8212;and even cuisine.</p>
<p>Though the autumn trees are best known for their leaf displays, they also burst forth with fruit like apples and pears. The fields, not to be outdone by the hills, brim with pumpkins and produce. Ramps, perennial wild onions with a powerfully pungent scent, are another Appalachian food tradition increasingly coveted by top-tier chefs.</p>
<p>Add to that summer berries, plentiful native trout and abundance from farm and field, and Appalachia has a recipe for culinary richness to rival that of its views.</p>

			</div>
			<h4>Ingredients</h4>
			<h4>Shell:</h4>
			<ul class="big-numbers">
				<li><p>1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</p></li>
				<li><p>1/4 cup sugar</p></li>
				<li><p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p></li>
				<li><p>1 stick (1/2 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into bits</p></li>
				<li><p>1 large egg yolk, beaten with 2 tablespoons ice water</p></li>
				<li><p>raw rice for weighting the shell</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Filling:</h4>
			<ul class="big-numbers">
				<li><p>1 cup buttermilk</p></li>
				<li><p>3 large egg yolks</p></li>
				<li><p>1/2 cup granulated sugar</p></li>
				<li><p>1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest</p></li>
				<li><p>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</p></li>
				<li><p>1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled</p></li>
				<li><p>1 teaspoon vanilla</p></li>
				<li><p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p></li>
				<li><p>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p></li>
				<li><p>2 cups picked over blueberries</p></li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="big-numbers">
				<li><p>confectioners' sugar for sprinkling the tart</p></li>
				<li><p>blueberry ice cream as an accompaniment if desired</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Method</h4>
			<h4>Shell:</h4>
			<p>In a bowl stir together the flour, the sugar, and the salt, add the butter, and blend the mixture until it resembles coarse meal. Add the yolk mixture, toss the mixture until the liquid is incorporated, and form the dough into a ball. Dust the dough with flour and chill it, wrapped in plastic wrap, for 1 hour. Roll out the dough 1/8 inch thick on a floured surface, fit it into a 10-inch tart pan with a removable fluted rim, and chill the shell for at least 30 minutes or, covered, overnight. Line the shell with foil, fill the foil with the rice, and bake the shell in the middle of a preheated 350&deg;F. oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and rice carefully, bake the shell for 5 to 10 minutes more, or until it is pale golden, and let it cool in the pan on a rack.</p>
			<h4>Filling:</h4>
			<p>In a blender or food processor blend together the buttermilk, the yolks, the granulated sugar, the zest, the lemon juice, the butter, the vanilla, the salt, and the flour until the mixture is smooth, spread the blueberries evenly over the bottom of the shell, and pour the buttermilk mixture over them. Bake the tart in the middle of a preheated 350&deg;F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the filling is just set.</p>
			<p>Let the tart cool completely in the pan on the rack, sprinkle it with the confectioners' sugar, sifted, and serve it at room temperature or chilled with the ice cream.</p>

				<li><p>1/4 cup Red Onion, small dice</p></li>

				<li><p>8 cups Water</p></li>
				<li><p>1.5 cups Heavy Cream</p></li>
				<li><p>1/2 cup Chevre</p></li>
				<li><p>s tbsp. <a href="http://www.franksredhot.com/" target="_blank">Frank's Red Hot Sauce</a></p></li>

			<ul class="big-numbers">
				<li><p>18 each Pickled Ramp, cut lengthwise on the bias</p></li>
				<li><p>2 tbsp. Parsley, finely chopped</p></li>
				<li><p>Aleppo Pepper, as needed</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Method</h4>
			<ol class="big-numbers">
				<li><p><strong>For the grits:</strong> In a medium pot, heat the oil over medium high heat and add the onion. Cook until translucent and stir in the garlic. Cook for about 30 seconds and pour in the water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.</p></li>
				<li><p>As the water comes to a boil, whisk in the grits, constantly stirring until they come together and begin to bubble&#8212;about 3&#8211;4 minutes. </p></li>
				<li><p>As the grits begin to bubble, remove the pot from the heat and immediately cover with plastic wrap and aluminum foil and keep in a warm place. Allow to "steam" for 45&#8211;50 minutes.</p></li>
				<li><p>After the grits have steamed, place the pot back on stove over medium heat. Stir in the heavy cream, chevre, Franks's Red Hot, salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Taste and re-season as necessary. Serve immediately.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>For the farm eggs:</strong> Bring an immersion circulator in a water bath to 65&deg;C. Place the eggs in a pasta basket and place in the water bath. Allow to cook for 45&#8211;50 minutes. (or you can poach the eggs in acidulated water for 1.5 minutes at a light simmer).</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>For the potlicker jus:</strong> Bring the potlicker jus to a simmer and mount in the butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>For the trout:</strong> Cut the trout fillets into 2 portions each, discarding the tail end. Season the skin side of the trout with salt and pepper.</p></li>
				<li><p>In a large cast iron pan, heat the oil over medium high heat and as the oil begins to shimmer, place the trout into the pan (skin side down), and allow to cook until the trout skin is crispy. Gently turn the trout over and reduce the heat to medium. Allow to cook for another 3&#8211;4 minutes, or until the trout is cooked through.</p></li>
				<li><p>To serve: Place a small cast iron serving skillet over a folded napkin on a small square plate. Place a 3" ring mold into the center of the round skillet. </p></li>
				<li><p>Place a teaspoon of the grits in the center of the ring mold.</p></li>
				<li><p>Crack a poached egg into a perforated bar straining spoon and place the egg directly on the grits. Gently mound more of the grits over the poached egg. Then place a piece of trout (skin side up) on the grits. Pour approximately 2 oz. of potlicker jus around the outside of the ring mold and garnish the trout with the sliced, pickled ramps. Garnish the plate with the chopped parsley and Aleppo pepper.</p></li>

<h3>Down on the farm</h3>
<img class="img-right imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/down-on-the-farm.jpg" alt="Kids with a kid down on the farm" />
<p class="">Family farms abound in and around Asheville&#8212;and Fairview's bucolic <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Hickory-Nut-Gap-Farm/4129/default/">Hickory Nut Gap</a> is as family as they come. Both Hickory Nut Gap and the adjacent Flying Cloud Farms sit on land settled in 1916 by Jim and Elizabeth McClure. Five generations of their descendants have since farmed the property.</p>
<p>Hickory Nut Gap offers pumpkin picking during the harvest season, plus a hay bale maze and an opportunity to meet piglets, ponies, calves and goats. A farm store carries local ice cream and cider, farm eggs and both fresh and cured meat.</p>
<p>See more of what Asheville has to offer on the farm front by checking out the <a href="http://asapconnections.org/events/asaps-farm-tour/" target="_blank">Appalachian Sustainable Agriculture Project's Farm Tour</a>, a self-guided driving tour of community food producers and small family farms, which takes place in late September. Any time of the year, download ASAP's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appalachian-grown/id560652853?mt=8" target="_blank">"Appalachian Grown" app</a> to locate local farms.</p>

<h4>Say cheese</h4>
<img class="img-right imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/looking-glass-creamery-farm.jpg" alt="Local Cheese-makers at Looking Glass Creamery" />
<p>In Asheville and the surrounding areas, artisan cheese is abundant and increasingly appreciated. To help spread the word, local cheese-makers created the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/food-adventures/wnc-cheese-trail/">WNC Cheese Trail</a>. A newly released map helps cheese cravers find hot spots like Looking Glass Creamery, which has a tiny tasting room full of big-flavored cheeses (and a patio with a lovely view). Or visit English Farmstead Cheese in Marion, where you can buy cheese made from the family cows from a quaint storefront. Many of the creameries also sell their wares at local tailgate markets across the region.</p>

<h4>Abundant apples</h4>
<img class="img-right imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/apple-bobbing.jpg" alt="Bobbing for Apples" />
<p>From the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/events/index.cfm?action=displayDetail&eventid=2253">NC Apple Festival</a> to <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/food-adventures/u-pick-farms/">u-pick farms</a>, harvest time means apples abound in WNC. Henderson County is North Carolina's apple mecca with 28 farms, many of which allow visits. Besides apples, expect to find baked goods, cider, hayrides and other harvest-time festive fun.</p>
<p>A bit farther afield in Spruce Pine, just off the Blue Ridge Parkway at mile marker 328, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/The-Historic-Orchard-at-Altapass/206/default/">The Orchard at Altapass</a> is part Appalachian cultural center, part apple bonanza. There you'll find 280 acres rich with heirloom apples (ripe for the picking in late summer), mountain music, story-telling hayrides and late-fall apple butter (jars of which make perfect souvenirs for those left behind in the low country).</p>

<img class="img-left imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/north-asheville-farmers-market.jpg" alt="An Asheville Farmers Market" />
<p>Though some close in November, plenty of holiday and indoor markets remain open, offering timeless (and season-less) Appalachian products like meats, cheese and crafts. Throughout autumn, tailgates and roadside stands are stocked with edible and decorative gourds, fall harvest arrangements and wreaths, various vegetables and more than enough jarred and packaged goods for stocking stuffers and Appalachian gifts.</p>
<p class="info" style="clear:both;">Visit the <a href="http://asapconnections.org/" target="_blank">Appalachian Sustainable Agriculture Project's</a> website to find tailgate markets, farm stands and holiday markets&#8212;all the better to enjoy the bounty of the harvest.</p>

<h4>Tour de Asheville</h4>
<p>Asheville is known as the Paris of the South for its galleries, cafes and world-class food scene.

There's <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Eating-Asheville/38/default/">Eating Asheville</a>, created by two local restaurant veterans, offering tours from the basic to the posh (with five whole drink pairings). The newly minted Dishcrawl tours four to eight restaurants, depending on your appetite, all within walking distance of each other. In a sipping and sitting mood? <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Brews-Cruise/">Try Brews Cruise</a>, which wheels you around the area's bevy of breweries. You did know Asheville is Beer City USA, didn't you?</p>

<h4>Oh honey, honey</h4>
<p>Asheville is also Bee City USA. The area loves its pollinators, which make possible up to two-thirds of what we eat. Wild Mountain Bees is a bee-centric store offering local honey, beekeeping needs and honey-based beauty products. It also has demonstrations geared toward both the advanced and aspiring beekeeper. For a different honey experience, visit the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Western-North-Carolina-Farmers-Market/139/default/">WNC Farmers Market</a>, which is brimming with honey and other locally made products (and boasts gorgeous views of the Blue Ridge Mountains).</p>

<h3>Harvest wild</h3>
<img class="img-right imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/alan-muskat-foraging-for-mushrooms.jpg" alt="Alan Muskat Foraging for Mushrooms" />
<p class="">Local foragers like <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/?action=display&listingID=4079&tab=">Alan Muskat</a>, featured on Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, know how to find forest delicacies like morel and chanterelle mushrooms. April through October, Muskat runs the Wild Foods Market, selling fungus and other edibles culled from the woods. He's also keen to teach amateurs the ways of the wild. Muskat regularly runs foraging expeditions, tailor-made to explore everything from backwoods hollers to the grand fields of the Biltmore Estate, according to your whims.</p>
<p>If mushrooms aren't quite your speed, Appalachian woods burst with berries&#8212;wine berries, blueberries, black raspberries and more&#8212;from June through first frost. Visit the <a href="http://www.longbrancheec.org/" target="_blank">Long Branch Educational Center</a> to find these fruits and others available for the picking.</p>

<h4>Go fish</h4>
<img class="img-right imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/images/fly-fishing.jpg" alt="Fly Fishing in Asheville, NC" />
<p>In the mountains of Asheville, fall harvest hiking is tough to beat, and the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/outdoor-adventures/blue-ridge-parkway/">Blue Ridge Parkway</a> offers numerous trails on which to leaf peep. But harvest season also means an abundance of trout in the Nantahala River, which is stocked with rainbow, brook and brown trout in the early fall. Trout require cold, clean water, so the mountains streams around Asheville provide the perfect environment. <a href="http://www.ncwildlife.org/Learning/Species/Fish/Trout/TroutFishing.aspx" target="_blank">The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission</a> has plenty of information about local trout, as well as how to get licensed.</p>
<p>No time for fishing? Visit Sunburst Trout Farms in Canton, where three generations of trout farmers have raised some of the best freshwater trout in the Southeast in water flowing from the Shining Rock Wilderness of Pisgah National Forest. The farm, which has a retail store offering everything from cold-smoked, gravlax-style trout to trout jerky, is open for visitors several days a week.</p>
