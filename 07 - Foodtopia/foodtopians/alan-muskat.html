<h2>No Taste Like Home</h2>
<p>Termites, thumb-sized green tomato worms, garden slugs, inky black mushrooms &mdash; Alan Muskat has eaten them all. As Asheville's resident forager, he finds, identifies and eats wild mushrooms, fruits, greens, nuts, seeds, flowers and shoots.</p>
<p>In all, 120 edible species grow in the Asheville area, and Muskat reveals them through his tour company, No Taste Like Home. &ldquo;Wild food is not difficult to find, and most of it grows in the city,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This Garden of Eden we live in here is very real, and the foundation is natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muskat started foraging for his own table in 1992, and over the following years, he began offering classes. Recently, he's witnessed a surge of interest in foraging. He attributes the trend to an increased focus on economics, health and environment: Wild food is free, pure and easy on the planet.</p>
<p>Asheville offers plenty of inspiration for the forager; Muskat has lived here 20 years, and he's still exploring. These mountains are one of the most bio-diverse regions in the world, he says, with more plant and animal species than just about anywhere except a tropical rainforest.</p>
<p>The landscape creates a place for creativity both in nature and in business, Muskat explains. &ldquo;People throughout history have come here to do their own thing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The reason the Scotch-Irish came here was because there are a lot of nooks and crannies. That's what also creates the natural diversity: micro-climates. There's a lot of other cities that can have a beer scene or a foodie scene, but when that kind of homegrown, do-it-yourself attitude is rooted in the geography, then you really have a foundation for something interesting.&rdquo;</p>
