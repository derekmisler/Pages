<p>When Adam Thome started working at Laurey's Cafe 14 years ago, it was a tiny catering shop and lunch counter on the edge of downtown. Since that time, Asheville has grown around Laurey's, providing it with a bustling sidewalk. Keeping pace, Laurey's has expanded into an Asheville institution, as beloved for its large sunny dining room as its fresh, seasonal lunches.</p>
<p>Diners chat with staff and make their selection from a bright deli case, filled with sweet potato salad, stuffed mushrooms and roast chicken. &quot;You see exactly what you're getting, and we love answering questions,&quot; Thome says. &quot;The case is good for conversation &mdash; it gets people talking about food. I love seeing people's reactions to a dish they're excited about.&quot;</p>
<p>The heaping plate that results, accompanied, perhaps, by sweet tea and a triple chocolate cookie, feels like it was prepared by a friend. &quot;It's very personal,&quot; Thome explains. &quot;People have an opportunity to add on to what we've created, and it helps them feel like it's theirs. Customers come in and make suggestions, and we listen to that.&quot;</p>
<p>Thome has grown with the restaurant. He was hired to take orders at the front counter, and he learned owner Laurey Masterton's secret to customer service &mdash; a ready smile and an attentive ear. Today, he and his wife, Emily Thome, manage the restaurant and uphold Masterton's legacy. She recently passed away after a life of activism, athleticism and great cooking. To learn more about her, pick up a cookbook from the shop. Her most recent, The Fresh Honey Cookbook, provides recipes for 12 varietals of honey and includes notes from her observations as a beekeeper.</p>
