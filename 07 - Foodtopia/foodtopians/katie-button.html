<p>Katie Button has worked in restaurants all over the world &mdash; New York City, Los Angeles; Paris; Roses, Spain; Washington D.C. &mdash; but she chose Asheville for her first restaurant, C&uacute;rate, a Spanish tapas bar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Asheville is a city where people move to make their dreams come true, to do what they love and are passionate about,” she says. &ldquo;I think that is palpable in the city, in the restaurants. It's this thing nobody can quite put their finger on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Button's dreams have materialized in the form of two world-class restaurants, which she owns with her family. At her newest, Nightbell, she serves playfully interpreted American favorites (think poached-to-order lobster rolls) and inventive cocktails. She displays modernist techniques, learned at elBulli (for many years, the world's best restaurant), through complex candies and liquid nitrogen-kissed concoctions.</p>

<p>While Asheville is proud to have Button, she would have risen to the top of her profession in any city. During her travels, she worked for José Andr&eacute;s, Ferran Adri&agrave; and Johnny Iuzzini, some of the world's top chefs. Since C&uacute;rate opened in 2011, she's been nominated for the James Beard Award three times.</p>

<p>She credits her success to ingredients, many of which come from local farms. The restaurant even partnered with a nearby pepper grower to produce piquillo peppers, which are typically grown in Spain. &ldquo;My food philosophy is about the ingredients first,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I'm always looking for the best products. From there, I tend to treat them pretty simply because if you start with a great product it doesn't need a whole lot more.&rdquo;</p>
