<p>The Barleycorn serves more than British pub fare and local beer; its staff provides lively conversation, explains owner Greg Campbell. &ldquo;They have talents beyond being a server or a bartender or a cook,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;One of our servers is a singer in a folk/indie group that tours the United States. Our dishwasher has a psychology degree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Campbell, who moved to Asheville from south Florida a year ago, says he’s never encountered such an intelligent and interesting crew. He encourages them to share their smarts with guests. After all, the Barleycorn is equal parts gastropub and neighborhood gathering place, explains Campbell, whose own extra-occupational interest in sociology inspired the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The energy behind it is based on this book called The Great Good Place,&rdquo; he elaborates. &ldquo;It says there are three places you socialize: your work, your home and what they call the third place. This is the place where you can come meet your neighbors and find common ground. I want to provide a vehicle for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hopes The Barleycorn will be that habitual place for newcomers and longtime residents of West Asheville. The menu inspires this enthusiasm with its array of kebabs, updated British classics and fun bar snacks, including homemade tater tots.</p>

<p>Since The Barleycorn opened in December 2013, the bacon jam has become a local favorite. A souvenir jar will bring back memories of familiar atmosphere and inventive cooking. &ldquo;In this business, you have to feed your soul,&rdquo; Campbell says. &ldquo;We’re all creative people, so we want to be creative in our food.&rdquo;</p>
