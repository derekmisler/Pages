<p>By Randy Talley’s estimation, Asheville consumes more natural food per capita than anywhere else, but just 22 years ago, this situation seemed impossible.</p>

<p>Talley, owner of The Green Sage Cafe, came to Asheville in 1992 to research the potential for a natural foods supermarket, Earth Fare. His team hired a renowned analyst to look for prospective customers; he couldn’t find any.</p>

<p>The analyst told Talley not to despair. &ldquo;He said some market characteristics are so rare they only exist in one place,&rdquo; Talley recalls. &ldquo;Perhaps Asheville has its own psyche, a rare psyche, so it can’t be compared to other markets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two decades later, Talley knows Asheville has that rare psyche and a hunger for healthy eats. The city boasts six natural groceries and three locations of Talley’s Green Sage Cafe, which serves nourishing meals in a casual, inviting atmosphere. &ldquo;We’re trying to be very good at the simplest things,&rdquo; Talley says. &ldquo;We’re trying to be the comfortable place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Locals flock to Green Sage for its Reuben with spicy kimchi, its cashew tempeh wrap, and its fairer-than-fair trade Thrive Farmers Coffee. Most of the menu is easily modified for vegetarians and sensitive eaters. &ldquo;The Green Sage is a place where someone who has dietary restrictions can take their friends,&rdquo; Talley says. &ldquo;He can get his burger, and she can get a gluten-free vegan burger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A meal at the cafe is also a way to support environmentally friendly innovations; see the rooftop solar panels, and add your scraps to the compost bin. Talley knows sustainability is important to Asheville diners, and he provides a restaurant that supports their values.</p>
