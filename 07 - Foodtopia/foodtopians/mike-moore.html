<h2>Seven Sows Bourbon &amp; Larder</h2>
<p>At his farmhouse outside of town, chef Michael Moore’s kitchen cabinets yield some strange ingredients. “I have ant larvae in my cupboard at home beside the brown sugar,” he admits.</p>

<p>But at his restaurant, Seven Sows Bourbon &amp; Larder, the food is far more familiar. “This is a concept that is pretty much my roots,” says the chef, who grew up in eastern North Carolina before moving to San Francisco to work with Ghetto Gourmet. “Everything I have on my menu here, this is all where I come from.”</p>

<p>The food at Seven Sows is old-school Southern in concept: deviled eggs, crispy chicken livers, buttermilk fried chicken with giblet gravy, and pork chops with grits and cracklin’s. But the atmosphere and culinary stylings might elicit gasps in Moore’s hometown of Wilson. Seven Sows is the punk rock version of an upscale Southern dining room.</p>

<p>So what exactly is Moore doing with those ant larvae in his cupboard? The chef has a penchant for the experimental, which he unleashes as director of the Blind Pig Supper Club. The events bring chefs together for a one-off dining experience. (For tickets, visit blindpigofasheville.com.) “We do different concept every single dinner, and we’ll focus on a musical artist, or we’ll focus on a cuisine, or we’ll focus on something that sort of transcends the guest to a different time and place,” Moore explains.</p>

<p>Blind Pig always delivers a great meal, but it also shows the cooperative spirit of the town’s culinarians. “We have inspired each other,” Moore says says. “There’s this boundless creativity that’s harnessed through Blind Pig. It gives these chefs an opportunity to push the limits.”</p>
