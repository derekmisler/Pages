<p>At his farmhouse outside of town, chef Michael Moore&rsquo;s kitchen cabinets yield some strange ingredients. &ldquo;I have ant larvae in my cupboard at home beside the brown sugar,&rdquo; he admits.</p>
<p>But at his restaurant, Seven Sows Bourbon &amp; Larder, the food is far more familiar. &ldquo;This is a concept that is pretty much my roots,&rdquo; says the chef, who grew up in eastern North Carolina before moving to San Francisco to work with Ghetto Gourmet. &ldquo;Everything I have on my menu here, this is all where I come from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The food at Seven Sows is old-school Southern in concept: deviled eggs, crispy chicken livers, buttermilk fried chicken with giblet gravy, and pork chops with grits and cracklin&rsquo;s. But the atmosphere and culinary stylings might elicit gasps in Moore&rsquo;s hometown of Wilson. Seven Sows is the punk rock version of an upscale Southern dining room.</p>
<p>So what exactly is Moore doing with those ant larvae in his cupboard? The chef has a penchant for the experimental, which he unleashes as director of the Blind Pig Supper Club. The events bring chefs together for a one-off dining experience. (For tickets, visit <a href="http://blindpigofasheville.com/" target="_blank">BlindPigOfAsheville.com</a>.) &ldquo;We do different concept every single dinner, and we&rsquo;ll focus on a musical artist, or we&rsquo;ll focus on a cuisine, or we&rsquo;ll focus on something that sort of transcends the guest to a different time and place,&rdquo; Moore explains.</p>
<p>Blind Pig always delivers a great meal, but it also shows the cooperative spirit of the town&rsquo;s culinarians. &ldquo;We have inspired each other,&rdquo; Moore says says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this boundless creativity that&rsquo;s harnessed through Blind Pig. It gives these chefs an opportunity to push the limits.&rdquo;</p>
