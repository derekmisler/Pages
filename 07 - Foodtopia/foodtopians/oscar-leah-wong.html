<p>Oscar Wong's retirement hasn't unfolded as planned. When he bought a home in Asheville in 1992, he didn't intend to create a regional beer brand, Highland Brewing, and spark a multimillion-dollar industry, but he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This has gone way bigger than I ever expected,&rdquo; Wong says of the brewery that started as a hobby and finally broke even after eight years of intensive quality control. This year, Asheville's oldest brewery will produce 40,000 barrels, more than any other local outfit.</p>

<p>Before he came to Asheville, Wong owned a Charlotte-based engineering firm that designed nuclear waste facilities. After spending so many years in a high-stakes field, he's bemused by the celebrity he's earned in beer circles. &ldquo;I was rather proud of what I did and didn't get much recognition on it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I get into beer &hellip; and people think this is pretty cool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leah Wong, Oscar's daughter, is one of those admirers. After years of consideration, she joined Highland in 2011. Soon, she'll run the growing business, which recently expanded its facility with a bottling line. &ldquo;With the purchase of this building and the land around it, we have beautiful dreams from the grass to the rooftop,&rdquo; Leah says. &ldquo;We're investing for the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Highland grows, Leah will maintain the values that inspired her father. &ldquo;From the start, he established the product and the people as high quality and treated everyone with respect,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;He's worked hard to be a good citizen. We want Asheville to be proud of Highland because Highland's really proud of Asheville.&rdquo;</p>
