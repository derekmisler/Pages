<p>Between mealtimes, Duane Fernandes keeps an eye on the door of Isa&rsquo;s Bistro, where he works as head chef. He&rsquo;s looking for farmers and fishermen who come to sell fresh produce, wild mountain herbs and seafood. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost like a big family,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re working in a big city, and everyone&rsquo;s on their own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Occasionally, the vendors approach with a rare treat &mdash; an unusual fish from the coast, fresh figs ripened in the sun or a basket of ramps, relatives of the onion that grow on mountain slopes. Fernandes creates dishes that highlight these specialties on the New American menu. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been about sourcing good ingredients from the start,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re fortunate to live in an area where there a lot of really great farms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the six years since Fernandes moved to Asheville from New York City, where he worked at Thomas Keller&rsquo;s Per Se, he&rsquo;s come to love the many farmers, growers and artisans. He serves bison and trout raised just up the road and pairs locally made cheese with honey from a nearby hive. &ldquo;I was very surprised when I got here to see so many local farms,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In New York, there&rsquo;s not so much of a local push. Everything is transported in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He admires both the fresh produce and the dedication to hard work required to grow it. At Isa&rsquo;s Bistro, he sees himself as part of this cycle that transforms soil and sunlight into fine cuisine. &ldquo;I like to focus on the tradition and skill and craft of cooking and keep it humble and simple and real,&rdquo; he says.</p>
