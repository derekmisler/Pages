<h2>&mdash;<br />Short Street Cakes</h2>
<p>Jodi Rhoden, owner of Short Street Cakes, started baking as a hobby &mdash; it just felt good to recreate family recipes. But before long, she was making cakes for friends, and her favorite pastime became a full-time job. &ldquo;Through baking, I was able to transform my life from being an unemployed, pregnant waitress to being a business owner,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It was a means for me of empowering myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, Rhoden stocks her Haywood Road shop with slices of salted caramel cake, handpies stuffed with fresh berries and rhubarb, coconut cupcakes and fresh-baked cookies. Visitors sit at vintage chrome and vinyl tables to enjoy their sweets or take home whole cakes and pies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me, cake very much embodies a sense of meaning and celebration in everyday life,&rdquo; Rhoden says. &ldquo;The women in my family baked traditional, Southern-style cakes from scratch. I offer honest, homestyle recipes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One cause for celebration? The community that supported Rhoden as she started her business back in 2006. The Georgia native credits much of her success to Asheville. &ldquo;Something that is definitely unique to Asheville is a sense of independence and entrepreneurship,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I think that Appalachian people have always been fiercely independent and self-reliant, and that has remained a value in Asheville unwaveringly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a way of giving back to the folks who helped her launch the cake shop, Rhoden serves as a business coach. &ldquo;Whatever those dreams are that people have, I want to help them empower themselves,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;For somebody, it might be building a house or opening an acupuncture clinic. For me, it was baking cake.&rdquo;</p>
