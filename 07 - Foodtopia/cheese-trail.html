<p>The Asheville area is home to dozens of mountain creameries, honoring the time-honed traditions of Appalachian artisanal cheese production. These farmstead cheese operations craft everything from savory chevre, to soft-ripened, to aged raw milk cheeses. Many of these dairy farms house their stock of goats, cows and sheep to ensure their milk source is sustainable and fresh. The resurgence of fine cheese production has ushered in a new era of southern decadence across the mountains.</p>
