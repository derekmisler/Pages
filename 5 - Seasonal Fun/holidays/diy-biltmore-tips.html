<ul class="big-numbers">
	<li><p>Choose a theme for your tree. A children's tree is always popular with antique or reproduction toys gathered around the base. For a softer look, consider using dried flowers, paper fans, ribbons, crocheted and handmade ornaments to create a Victorian looking tree.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you have antique collectibles, showcase them during the holiday season. Nestle them in evergreen and choose decorative ribbons that will tie in your color scheme.</p></li>
	<li><p>Instead of red and green, sprinkle crimson, burgundy, champagne, and gold throughout your holiday colors scheme. Survey the colors in your home and coordinate appropriately, or just try a combination you like.</p></li>
	<li><p>Wrap a staircase in evergreen roping and punctuate with moire bows.</p></li>
	<li><p>Include hanging prints or photos in your holiday decorating. Trim them with fresh greenery, dried flowers or ribbons to add color.</p></li>
	<li><p>Make a gumdrop tree by placing several small branches in a clay pot. Press Sugar-coated gumdrops on the twigs, and place small, brightly wrapped packages around the base.</p></li>
	<li><p>Cluster fresh flowers such as paper wipes, with  globed candles and nestle them in a bed of ivy or evergreen on a sideboard or occasional table. Drape with strands of glass beads and crystal ornaments for dazzling holiday arrangements.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use festoons of greenery, instead of traditional wreaths. Decorate with silk bows, old-fashioned ornaments or dried flowers.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use handmade ornaments side-by-side with hand blown glass ornaments similar to those used in the 19th century. Ornate Victorian patterned paper can be folded into paper fans that are decorated with a bow. Pomander balls (dried fruit with embedded whole cloves wrapped with tulle and ribbon) are not only decorative but fragrant.</p></li>
