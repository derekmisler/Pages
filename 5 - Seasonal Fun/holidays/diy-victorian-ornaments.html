<p>On Christmas Eve 1985, when the Vanderbilts first opened the doors of Biltmore to their guests, the house's 250 rooms were decorated in grand Victorian fashion, including dozens of ornament-laden Christmas trees. At the turn-of-the-century, many Christmas ornaments were made by hand and displayed a simple elegance to guests and visitors. The easy-to-make decorations presented here from Biltmore's floral staff will bring the essence of Biltmore's Victorian Christmas to your own home.</p>
<h3>Pearl Sphere</h3>
<p>Cover a foam ball with corsage pins purchased from a local florist or craft store. If the ball is small, shorten pins with wire cutters. Hang with a loop of satin ribbon held in place with one of the pins.</p>
<h3>Paper Fans</h3>

<p>Fold small paper rectangles (made from wrapping paper scraps or used holiday cards) from side to side in 1-inch accordion pleats. Fold paper in half lengthwise first if you want the print to show on both sides. Before folding, you can decorate the edge with lace or ribbon. Decorate folded fan with tiny craft beads, ribbon bows, glitter, sequins or silk flowers, attaching them with hot glue.</p>
<h3>Feather Wreaths</h3>
<p>Cut doughnuts from cardboard one inch smaller than desired finished size. A finished size of three inches is good in decorating most trees. Cut feathers, purchased at a craft store, into 1 1/2 to 2-inch pieces. Glue one layer of feathers to cover the front of the doughnut. Glue a second layer of feathers overlapping the first layer. When the front is completely dry, repeat the process on other side of the doughnut. Decorate with gold beads, ribbons, or silk or dried flowers. Hang with satin ribbon loop.</p>
<h3>Paper Cornucopias </h3>
<p>Roll round paper doilies into a cone and staple to hold in place. A bit of tissue tucked into it helps the cone hold its shape. Fill with small pieces of candy, such as gumdrops or peppermints. Attach ends of an 8-inch strip of ribbon to either side of the cone to form a hanger.</p>
<h3>Pomander Ball</h3>
<p>Apples, oranges, lemons or limes will work. Pears work well because they retain a pretty shape as they dry. Push whole cloves into fruit (protect fingers with adhesive bandage strips.) Shake fruit in paper bag containing several teaspoons of ground cinnamon. Close top of bag and store in a warm spot such as the top of the refrigerator for two weeks, turning fruit daily. Cover dried fruit with rectangles of tulle (a starched net material), and close at the top with ribbons. Hang with satin ribbon loop.</p>
<h3>Ice-Cream Cones</h3>
<p>Glue a foam ball to the top of a sugar cone. Paint foam with white craft glue. Cover foam with rectangular piece of cotton batting cut large enough to cover entire ball. Pull the edges of the batting down in one or two places to look like drips. Sprinkle top with diamond dust (purchased at local craft store). Attach ends of an 8-inch strip of ribbon to either side of ball with pins to form a hanger. Attach tiny bows with glue or pins to cover ribbon attachment. For a variation, dip glue-covered foam in lavender or potpourri instead of covering with cotton batting.</p>
