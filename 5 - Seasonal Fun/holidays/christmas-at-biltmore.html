</div>
<p>Christmas Eve 1895, and Biltmore House was bustling with activity. In just a few hours, George Vanderbilt would officially open his new home in Asheville, N.C., to family and friends with a lavish party.</p>
<p>From the kitchen came rich smells of holiday food. Among the palms in the Winter Garden were bright exotic botanical poinsettias, and the faint smell of evergreen filled the grand house. Then as now, it was Christmas at Biltmore.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt's descendants carry on their great grandfather's tradition of holiday hospitality with decorations, music, food and gifts that make Christmas at Biltmore one of the Southeast's most beloved holiday traditions. </p>
<h3>Christmas Decorations on a Grand Scale</h3>
<p>How do you decorate America's largest private home for Christmas? It takes months of planning, dozens of Fraser-fir trees, miles of ribbon, red and white poinsettias by the truckload, thousands of ornaments and an abundance of imagination.</p>
<p>The <a href="#event-details">holiday season at Biltmore</a> officially begins in early November with the arrival of a jaw-dropping 35-foot Fraser fir tree in the Banquet Hall. Its branches soon glisten with small, colorfully-wrapped packages, recalling the days when Vanderbilt and his family hosted estate employees and their families for a Christmas celebration, and each child received a gift off the tree.</p>
<p>Today, you can find a wide assortment of Estate-themed holiday gifts at the many shops that dot the estate.</p>
<h3>Victorian Christmas Traditions Come Alive</h3>
