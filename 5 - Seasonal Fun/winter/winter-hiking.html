Some would say winter is the best season for hiking in the Southern Appalachians. Free from the heat of summer, one can enjoy the crisp cool air and stunning views revealed by leafless trees. But don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;there&rsquo;s no need to break out the snow shoes. All that&rsquo;s required is a sturdy pair of boots and lots of warm layers. See below for a list of our favorite hiking trails:
