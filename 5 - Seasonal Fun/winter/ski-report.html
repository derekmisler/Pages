<h3>January 8, 2014</h3>
<p><strong>Cold temps, cool slopes:</strong> To say that this week has been chilly would be quite the understatement, but all that cold air has been great for snow making, and has brought a little snow of its own to the mountaintops surrounding Asheville. The result is a great base at area ski slopes and lots of open runs.</p>
<p class="info"><strong>Area Weather Forecast: The Week Ahead</strong><br />Temperatures will be warming during the next few days and will range from right around freezing up to the upper 50s. Watch out for some light showers on Thursday and Friday with some additional wet weather approaching for the weekend.</p>
