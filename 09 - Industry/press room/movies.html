&quot;Quiet on the set!&quot; is not a phrase you think you&rsquo;d hear while   admiring the serene beauty of the peaks in Western North Carolina. But,   more and more Hollywood producers have found that these 6,000-foot peaks   provide visually spectacular backdrops for the motion picture industry.
</p>
<p>
&quot;North Carolina has more production complexes and sound stages than   any state in the nation outside of California,&quot; said Asheville resident   Michael Bigham, North Carolina locations manager for <i>Last of the   Mohicans</i> and a Hollywood scout for <i>The Hunger Games</i> and other productions.
</p>
<p>
And Western North Carolina captured the attention of Hollywood years ago.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5rem">The first movie shot in Asheville was in the 1920s. Titled </span><i style="line-height: 1.5rem">Conquest   of Canaan</i><span style="line-height: 1.5rem">, the movie was filmed in what is now Pack Square in downtown   Asheville, and tells the story of a lawyer who makes good in a small   town.</span>
