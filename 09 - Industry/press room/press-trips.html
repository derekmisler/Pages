</p>
<p>
As you can imagine, we receive numerous requests from travel writers each year. In order to accommodate your editorial needs, we need your help in complying with the following guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>We request <b>a minimum of two business weeks notice</b> for a press visit once we have received all your credentialing information. This allows us time to pursue suitable, available lodging and make other arrangements to enhance your visit.</li>
	<li>Email your request, including the name of the publication(s) you are working for, circulation figures, the dates you will be traveling and any other relevant details (number in travel party, story angle, etc.) to media@exploreasheville.com.</li>
	<li>Forward a letter of assignment from the media outlet you are representing.</li>
	<li>Freelance writers, please forward documentation of recent examples of travel or travel-related feature coverage.</li>
	<li>Notify the Asheville CVB of any change in plans immediately.</li>
	<li>Forward an original copy of your published feature or broadcast clip, as well as air dates, upon completion. Links are wonderful, but at least one hard copy is always appreciated.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>
Please note that complimentary arrangements are provided at the discretion of the host businesses and are subject to availability.</b> Black-out periods may be experienced throughout the year that may necessitate a press rate, especially at hotels. Unfortunately, the Asheville CVB cannot provide airfare for your trip, nor can we pay for ground or meals.
</p>
<p>
Please understand that our primary concern is assisting working press. Therefore, host locations are usually unable to accommodate spouses, children and visitors accompanying working press.
</p>
<p>
Again, thank you for your interest in the beautiful mountains of Asheville, North Carolina. We look forward to assisting you in your travel research, and are more than happy to help you brainstorm ways to explore our mountain destination.
