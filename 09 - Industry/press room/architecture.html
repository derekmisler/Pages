ASHEVILLE, N.C.&mdash;One city suffered a greater financial hardship than all others from the 1929 Crash, shouldering a per capita debt burden that was the greatest in the country. Today, the liability that city carried for almost 50 years has turned it into an American architectural treasure. 
</p>
<p>
No, it was not New York, or St. Louis, or Chicago. The &quot;City That Suffered Most&quot; was Asheville, North Carolina, a municipality that was so poor for so long that ancient buildings never faced the bulldozers of urban renewal. 
</p>
<p>
The result is a city that reflects a different era in American architecture, a city that is only now shaking off the dust and rust of almost 60 years and carefully restoring buildings that would have disappeared long ago from most American cities. 
</p>
<p>
Asheville today is more than a city where architecture stood still for several generations. It is distinctive because in the year time stopped, 1929, it was a boom town, a home for the Vanderbilts, a resort for Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and other historic luminaries, and a mecca for rising young architects following in the footsteps of one of the masters, Richard Morris Hunt, who built the lavish Biltmore House in Asheville in 1895.
</p>
<h1>Asheville's Architectural Odd Couple</h1>
<p>
<img alt="Art Deco Buildings" class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images//media/images/Art_Deco_Buildings.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="200" height="178" hspace="10" />The styles of architecture reflect the temperament of different designers, and the moods of the city at different periods. Downtown, for example, is home to the mountain city&rsquo;s own structural odd couple -- a flashy Art Deco-style city hall, its peaking mountain silhouette veiled with a pink and green tiled octagonal roof, and, next to city hall, in sharply masculine, conventional juxtaposition, the Buncombe County Courthouse. 
</p>
<p>
The two structures surprisingly were completed in the same year, 1928, and were to have been designed by the same man, Douglas Ellington, who popularized the Art Deco style he had come to admire as a student in Paris. As work started on the city hall building, however, local officials decided its design was too extravagant and had someone else take over the county building project. 
</p>
<p>
This architectural bride and groom at the city's center stand as metaphor for the contrasting influences of mountain culture and modern culture which have existed in Asheville since the 1880s. Begun as a frontier outpost in 1797, Asheville was originally little more than a crossroads of Indian trails on a plateau. Surrounded by imposing mountains on all sides at the confluence of the French Broad and Swannanoa Rivers, Asheville would later be described by its native son, novelist Thomas Wolfe, as a town existing within the rim of an enormous cup. 
</p>
<p>
Previously the land of frontiersmen like Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett, Asheville and Buncombe County were transformed into a resort town and a center for therapeutic health treatments after the railroad arrived in l880. Asheville became a mecca for visitors wishing for a mountain escape, its population climbing to 10,325 in l890 and its &quot;summer people&quot; in l886 numbering nearly 30,000.
</p>
<h1>A Vanderbilt Builds America's Largest Home in Asheville</h1>
<p>
The area also attracted the rich and famous. None of its visitors left a greater impact upon Asheville than one of these influential men of the l890s who decided to build his home here--George Washington Vanderbilt, whose <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/what-to-do/activity-details/index.aspx?guid=80e3a6b5-274d-4686-b6b0-428569b741c6">Biltmore Estate</a> and 250-room Biltmore House continue to be Asheville landmarks. 
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Biltmore Estate" class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/images/biltmore-_estate_2.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="250" height="151" hspace="10" />Vanderbilt thought Asheville the most beautiful city in the world and bought 125,000 acres of land there. He then commissioned noted architect Richard Morris Hunt to build the most luxurious private residence in America upon the property, and hired Frederick Law Olmsted to supervise the landscape architecture of the estate. 
</p>
<p>
Hunt modeled the French renaissance chateau after those of the 16th century in the Loire Valley in France. Indiana limestone was brought into the area by train, stone-carvers and woodcarvers contributed their artwork to the interior and exterior of the house, and Vanderbilt spent years in Europe and the Orient buying antiques and art for his great house. 
</p>
<p>
In l895, after five years and a million man hours of labor, Biltmore House was completed. 
</p>
<p>
Not only did the establishment of the estate and Vanderbilt's presence there enhance Asheville's reputation as an exclusive area, the work at Biltmore Estate also required the skill of European craftsmen. Many of these talented workmen remained in Asheville and spread their influence throughout the city in architectural projects.
</p>
<h1>Grove Park Inn - Asheville's Grand Mountain Resort</h1>
<p>
<img alt="Grove Park Inn" class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images//media/images/accommodation_gpi.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="200" height="137" hspace="10" />Another wealthy man of grand vision who left his imprint on the architectural style of Asheville was Edwin Wiley Grove, a medicine manufacturer who came to Asheville in 1897 seeking relief from his bronchial difficulties. 
</p>
<p>
Grove became enamored with a grand, yet rustic, mountain lodge he had seen at Yellowstone Park. He sought an architect who could grasp the notion of an indigenous building designed with a regional style appropriate for a mountain setting. 
</p>
<p>
Frustrated with his inability to find such an architect, Grove entrusted the construction and design to his son-in-law, who had no architectural experience. The result was the still popular <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/what-to-do/activity-details/index.aspx?guid=75a589ab-aa20-43c7-a27d-c6ffd26d7485">Grove Park Inn Resort &amp; Spa</a>, a massive hotel made of native uncut granite boulders laid over a reinforced concrete frame. 
</p>
<p>
Grove's son-in-law ignored the currently popular styles that characterized most of the downtown buildings in Asheville. The materials from which the hotel was constructed were taken in large part from the mountain on which it stands. Huge boulders which form the walls of the hotel, some weighing up to five tons, were brought to the site by trains of 15 wagons carrying over 40 tons of stone each trip. 
</p>
<p>
Red clay tile produced in Tennessee, and visible for miles, covers the main roof, overhanging the walls in great undulating eaves. The main lobby is 120 feet long and 80 feet wide, and contains fireplaces that can accommodate 12-foot logs.
</p>
<h1>Thomas Wolfe Looks Homeward</h1>
<p>
Although Asheville's reputation as a resort for the wealthy was well known, its appeal for the middle class traveler seeking relief from summer heat was also widespread. The <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/what-to-do/activity-details/index.aspx?guid=c6daf079-6483-4a53-8b8b-e8997a0e431a">Thomas Wolfe Memorial Home</a> is an example of the boarding houses that sprang up in Asheville to accommodate the visitor of more modest means. 
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Thomas Wolfe Memorial Home" class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/images/thomas_wolfe_memorial_home_2.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" width="200" height="148" hspace="10" />The large 19-room Queen Anne style house had drafty, high-ceilinged rooms and a rambling, unplanned appearance. Built in the early 1880s, it is one of the oldest residences surviving in the downtown area. 
</p>
<p>
Wolfe, Asheville's most famous native son, immortalized the house in &quot;Look Homeward, Angel,&quot; a novel which is mostly autobiographical. The house, named Dixieland in the work, is the setting for the experiences of the author as a young boy growing up in his mother's boarding house. Although the all-too-vivid portrayal of Asheville and its citizens was considered so unflattering by locals that the book was banned from the city library, Wolfe's home is considered one of Asheville's most important and significant historical sites.
</p>
<h1>Asheville's Awe-Inspiring Churches</h1>
<p>
At the core of any thriving Southern city, of course, is its church community. Asheville's great churches reflect the city's architectural heritage and the same caliber of excellence in design as the city's other landmarks, many of the churches sharing mutual architects and designers with the city's most significant structures. Three of Asheville's most famous churches were constructed during the 1895 to 1925 time period. 
</p>
<p>
In <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/what-to-do/activity-details/index.aspx?guid=68e37d6f-dd50-4bbf-87b2-c277a93a847b">Biltmore Village</a> (a community established and built by Vanderbilt to house and support estate workers) the social and architectural focal point is All Souls Episcopal Church (1896). The extraordinarily complicated structure is designed in the shape of a Greek cross with a massive central tower. The church's memorial windows are made of opalescent glass using a pre-Gothic method which produced amazing richness and depth of color. The features of the building include pebbledash surfaces and expansive tile roofs. 
</p>
<p>
All Souls and much of Biltmore Village were designed by Richard Sharp Smith, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Biltmore House architect Richard Morris Hunt. 
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Saint Lawrence Basilica" class="imgshadow" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/images/saint_lawrence_basilica.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="183" height="200" hspace="10" />Another architect involved in the Biltmore House project was a Spanish designer named Rafael Guastavino. Guastavino is also responsible for the legacy of the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/what-to-do/activity-details/index.aspx?guid=6b7f8101-cc87-4d03-a23d-56a7b394da38">Basilica of St. Lawrence Catholic Church</a> (1909) in downtown Asheville, a structure employing two Spanish Baroque towers rising to a height of five stories. Each tower is capped with a parapeted wall enclosing a bulbous dome; each dome is sheathed with pink, green, brown and white tiles. 
</p>
<p>
Guastavino's own technique, &quot;cohesive construction,&quot; was utilized in the St. Lawrence project. The church, considered a true architectural masterpiece, contains the largest unsupported tile dome in the United States, measuring 52 by 82 feet. 
</p>
<p>
The construction of the dome is a story in itself. Built without the use of scaffolding or shoring, Guastavino started at the outside walls and cemented in the tiles one at a time all around, subsequently building up the roof layers going into the center using the tile he had recently cemented in place as his working platform. 
</p>
<p>
Still, it is the flamboyant Art Deco style which Douglas Ellington brought to Asheville that perhaps remains most typical of the city. A native North Carolinian, Ellington left his signature throughout the downtown Asheville area, combining his love of color and design with his European training. One of the most notable results is the First Baptist Church (1925-26). An unusual early Italian renaissance form accented with Ellington's own Art Deco detailing, the church demands and receives admiration and attention. 
</p>
<p>
Ellington employed a gradation of colored mission tiles on the dome, ranging from green to dark red. Orange bricks, terra cotta moldings and pink marble combine in the walls. 
</p>
<p>
Retrospectively, it was fortunate that after Asheville's largest bank and five other financial institutions closed on November 20, 1930, and after Buncombe County, the city of Asheville and the public school system lost almost $8 million, the city fathers did the honorable thing. 
</p>
<p>
In 1936, Asheville refinanced its debt. And now the city's historic district of approximately 170 buildings stands as one of the most comprehensive collections of early 20th century commercial architecture in North Carolina.
