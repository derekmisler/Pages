<p>Below, you'll find green meeting resources that will help you plan a more sustainable event in Asheville. Reducing the environmental impact of guests on the beautiful mountains of Western North Carolina is a fundamental objective of the entire Asheville hospitality community. It is part of the region's heritage and is embraced as part of the brand that makes Asheville one of the truly special places in the world to visit.</p>
<h2>The Asheville Offset</h2>
<img width="250"class="imgshadow img-right" alt="Sawing" src="http://www.exploreasheville.com/includes/content/images/media/images/sawing.jpg" />
<p>The Asheville Offset offers an opportunity for the attendees of meetings and conventions to directly impact the sustainability and social well-being of their host city.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Asheville Offset is an opportunity to contribute (per attendee or per group) to the <strong>Insulate!</strong> program of Asheville&rsquo;s Warren Wilson College.</li>
	<li>Meeting attendees may choose to purchase an offset to mitigate environmental impacts of their travel and activities while in Asheville. All of the money goes directly back into the local community through the <strong>Insulate!</strong> program, which weatherizes the homes of citizens below the poverty level, free of charge, thus reducing utility bills, energy usage and corresponding carbon emission. The offset donation is flexible and we work with each group on their individual commitment.</li>
	<li>People below the poverty line can spend more than 1/3 of their total annual income to heat and cool their house. Weatherizing can create as much as a 30% reduction in energy used. The homes are owned by seniors who have requested assistance through the Buncombe County Council on Aging. Student volunteers carry out the work and conduct pre- and post- energy audits and monitoring of the homes.</li>
	<li>Warren Wilson College is a national leader in sustainable education and stewardship, and its <strong>Insulate!</strong> program has been duplicated across the nation.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Natural beauty is part of Asheville and our local culture is infused with the desire to celebrate and protect it. Groups come here for that connection and now they can take part in it with a simple, yet mindful, offset donation. The Asheville Offset allows attendees to reduce their carbon footprint in a way that directly reduces energy consumption on a local level in Asheville.</blockquote>

<h2>The best team building can happen when it&rsquo;s not about the team.</h2>
<p>A community service project creates a unique team building opportunity. A shared, active experience with positive goals can be fun and energizing for attendees as well as make a beneficial impact on the environment or residents of your host city.</p>
<p>Here are some visiting groups that have given back to the Asheville community:</p>
