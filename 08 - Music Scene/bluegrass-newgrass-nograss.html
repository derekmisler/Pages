<p>A progressive and collaborative arts community, Asheville's modern music scene melds old and new with surprising ease. Music permeates the city from the street musicians who serenade you downtown, to multi-generation bluegrass jam sessions, to a rock club (<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Orange-Peel-Social-Aid-and-Pleasure-Club/315/default/">Orange Peel Social Aid and Pleasure Club</a>) named one of the best in the country by Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>Today, Asheville's music scene is all encompassing. Traditional mountain music still rings out from national artists such as David Holt and Laura Boosinger who live in the area. Classical music from the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Symphony-Orchestra-/311/default/">Asheville Symphony Orchestra</a> fills the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Thomas-Wolfe-Auditorium/55/default/">Thomas Wolfe Auditorium</a> throughout the year.</p>
<h3>Hear local and world musicians perform in Asheville</h3>
<p>People have been traveling to Asheville to hear music for generations. In 1928, the Asheville Chamber of Commerce asked local folklorist Bascom Lamar Lunsford to invite local musicians and dancers for an event to encourage tourism.</p>
<p>His creation was the Mountain Folk and Dance Festival, which was so successful that it became a permanent event. Today, the combination of traditional music and mountain beauty remain a major draw for the city's multitude of visitors. And just as the Asheville area has grown, so has its range of musical offerings.</p>

<p>The sounds of the modern era also thrive in Asheville. Bob Moog, the inventor of the Moog synthesizer and pioneer of <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/arts-entertainment/music-scene/music-festivals/">electronic music</a>, spent his final years in Asheville and set up a <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Moog-Music-Factory/3804/default/">company</a> here that continues his musical vision.</p>
<p>Alternative rockers The Smashing Pumpkins made Asheville their temporary home with a nine-show residency in 2007 at the Orange Peel. And well-known artists such as <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/about-asheville/cool-asheville-stories/celebrities-in-asheville/">Gladys Knight, Warren Haynes and David Wilcox</a> have made Asheville their newfound home and drawn inspiration from the area.</p>
