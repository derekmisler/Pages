<h3>Hear local and world musicians perform in Asheville.</h3>
<p>People have been traveling to Asheville to hear music for generations. In 1928, the Asheville Chamber of Commerce asked local folklorist Bascom Lamar Lunsford to invite local musicians and dancers for an event to encourage tourism.</p>
<p>His creation was the <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/things-to-do/arts-entertainment/music-scene/music-legacy/">Mountain Folk and Dance Festival</a>, which was so successful that it became a permanent event. Today, the combination of traditional music and mountain beauty remain a major draw for the city's multitude of visitors.
