	<li><strong>The Nation's Longest Running Folk Festival</strong> – Since 1928, mountain fiddlers, banjo pickers, dulcimer sweepers, dancers, balladeers and others have come to enjoy themselves "along about sundown" the first weekend in August at the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival.</li>
	<li><strong>Bluegrass Buskers</strong> – Nowhere is the music culture and bluegrass influence more accessible than on the streets of Asheville. When the weather is nice, nearly every downtown corner offers a spontaneous stage. Head to Pack Square or the iconic Flat Iron statue along the Urban Trail for bands like 13 Strings and a Two Dollar Bill, Flat Creek Trio and The Leather Britches.</li>
	<li><strong>Asheville Music Hall Haunts</strong> – From intimate listening rooms to large music halls ideal for dancing, Asheville area music venues run the gamut: <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Grey-Eagle-Tavern-and-Music-Hall-/142/default/">Grey Eagle</a>, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/White-Horse-Black-Mountain/137/default/">White Horse Black Mountain</a>, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Isis-Restaurant-and-Music-Hall/4245/default/">Isis Music Hall</a> and The Orange Peel offer variety in their line-ups, but bluegrass and roots can always be found if you watch the schedules. Tip: Asheville's breweries are also musically inclined. <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Pisgah-Brewing-Company/431/default/">Pisgah</a>, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Highland-Brewing-Company/191/default/">Highland</a>, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Wedge-Brewing-Company/372/default/">Wedge</a> and <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/French-Broad-Brewing-Company/199/default/">French Broad Brewing</a> all offer live music with craft beer cool.</li>

	<li><strong>Contra and Square Dance</strong> – Pack a skirt that twirls! European and American folk dance is seeing a revival, and nowhere is that more clear than in the mountains of Western NC. At Grey Eagle, Warren Wilson or White Horse Black Mountain, the locals will take you in their arms, quite literally, and show you the steps.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Drum-Circle/343/default/">Asheville Drum Circle</a></strong> – You might hear a fiddle or banjo thrown in the mix, but the instrument of choice for this 10+ year Asheville music tradition is the drum. Follow the pounding rhythm downtown to a dance party under the stars. You can't help but move your feet.</li>
