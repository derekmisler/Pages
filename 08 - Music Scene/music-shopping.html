	<h4>These Hills are Alive with the Sound of Appalachian Music</h4>
	<p>The instruments needed for distinct mountain sound have old world origins. The banjo hails from Africa and the fiddle has European roots. However, the only native instrument to the mountain region, is the Appalachian dulcimer. This instrument is considered to be one of the easiest to learn due to its small string count and simplified fret system. Want to find one for yourself? Visit the Grove Arcade in downtown Asheville where the <a href="http://thewoodrow.com/" target="_blank">Woodrow</a> stringed instruments are sold. If you travel to Black Mountain visit <a href="http://songofthewood.com/">Song of the Wood</a> to see a wide collection of mountain dulcimers for sale.</p>
