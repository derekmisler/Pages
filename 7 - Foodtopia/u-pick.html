<p class="intro">What could be better than standing in the late spring or summer sunshine, the wind brushing your face as you hold the ripest, juiciest strawberry you&rsquo;ve ever seen in your hands? Maybe picking it, and trying not to let the juice run down your chin? This simple pleasure can be had at several U-Pick farms where you can pick your own fresh, juicy produce.</p>
<p>Vacation cuisine can be&nbsp;about more than just ordering at a restaurant. All around Asheville, you&rsquo;ll find people planting produce delicacies and opening up their farms and gardens to visitors. Many offer &ldquo;U-pick,&rdquo; or pick-your-own produce options for those wanting to explore off-the-beaten track spots across the mountains. There, you can see where food it grown, pick some yourself and treat yourself and your family to a unique experience.</p>
<p>It makes going to the supermarket for a pint of berries &ndash; go ahead, you can admit it &ndash; just a bit boring.</p>

<p>Give each of these farms a call before you go, grab a cooler to stash your pickings, and head out into the fields this summer for some of the best locally grown produce you can find. Also, because pick-your-own produce options depend on the time of year, weather and crop yields, call to check that your favorite vegetable or fruit is available.</p>
