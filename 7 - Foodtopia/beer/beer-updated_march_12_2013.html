	<h2>Hopping Brewing Scene</h2>
	<h4>The Evolution of a Beer Town</h4>
	<p>Asheville&rsquo;s beer culture all started back in 1994, when Oscar Wong, a retired engineer living in Charlotte, moved to Asheville and opened <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Highland-Brewing-Company/191/default/">Highland Brewing Company</a> in a rustic basement space below <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Barley-s-Taproom-Pizzeria/478/default/">Barley&rsquo;s Taproom and Pizzeria</a> in downtown Asheville.</p>
	<p>What began as a home-brew hobby became the first successful brewery operation in Asheville landing Wong his status as godfather of &ldquo;<a target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window" href="http://www.examiner.com/article/grand-rapids-asheville-share-beercity-usa-2012-title">Beer City USA</a>.&rdquo; Since then, Asheville has seen a number of breweries open their doors.</p>
	<p>Today the craft beer scene in Asheville has reached a fever pitch with five<a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/foodtopia/food-adventures/asheville-beer/beer-celebrations/"> annual beer festivals</a>, <a href="http://www.exploreasheville.com/listings/Asheville-Brews-Cruise/314/default/">brewery tours</a> and even a popular ice cream made with Highland&rsquo;s rich black mocha stout.</p>
	<p>Asheville is <a target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window" href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/05/asheville-wins-again.html">four-time winner</a> of the annual Beer City USA poll, hosted by Charlie Papazian with Examiner.com. This designation helped put Asheville&rsquo;s beer scene on the map and garnered the attention of <a target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window" href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/01/sierra-nevada-is-asheville-bound.html">Sierra Nevada</a> and <a target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window" href="http://blog.exploreasheville.com/2012/04/new-belgium-brewing-ashevilles-newest.html">New Belgium Brewing</a>.
