			<h3>Method</h3>
			<ol class="big-numbers">
				<li><p><strong>For the grits:</strong> In a medium pot, heat the oil over medium high heat and add the onion. Cook until translucent and stir in the garlic. Cook for about 30 seconds and pour in the water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.</p></li>
				<li><p>As the water comes to a boil, whisk in the grits, constantly stirring until they come together and begin to bubble&#8212;about 3&#8211;4 minutes. </p></li>
				<li><p>As the grits begin to bubble, remove the pot from the heat and immediately cover with plastic wrap and aluminum foil and keep in a warm place. Allow to "steam" for 45&#8211;50 minutes.</p></li>
				<li><p>After the grits have steamed, place the pot back on stove over medium heat. Stir in the heavy cream, chevre, Franks's Red Hot, salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Taste and re-season as necessary. Serve immediately.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>For the farm eggs:</strong> Bring an immersion circulator in a water bath to 65&deg;C. Place the eggs in a pasta basket and place in the water bath. Allow to cook for 45&#8211;50 minutes. (or you can poach the eggs in acidulated water for 1.5 minutes at a light simmer).</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>For the potlicker jus:</strong> Bring the potlicker jus to a simmer and mount in the butter. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p></li>
				<li><p><strong>For the trout:</strong> Cut the trout fillets into 2 portions each, discarding the tail end. Season the skin side of the trout with salt and pepper.</p></li>
				<li><p>In a large cast iron pan, heat the oil over medium high heat and as the oil begins to shimmer, place the trout into the pan (skin side down), and allow to cook until the trout skin is crispy. Gently turn the trout over and reduce the heat to medium. Allow to cook for another 3&#8211;4 minutes, or until the trout is cooked through.</p></li>
				<li><p>To serve: Place a small cast iron serving skillet over a folded napkin on a small square plate. Place a 3" ring mold into the center of the round skillet. </p></li>
				<li><p>Place a teaspoon of the grits in the center of the ring mold.</p></li>
				<li><p>Crack a poached egg into a perforated bar straining spoon and place the egg directly on the grits. Gently mound more of the grits over the poached egg. Then place a piece of trout (skin side up) on the grits. Pour approximately 2 oz. of potlicker jus around the outside of the ring mold and garnish the trout with the sliced, pickled ramps. Garnish the plate with the chopped parsley and Aleppo pepper.</p></li>
