<p class="intro">Asheville's culinary festivals and food-filled street fairs are year-round and celebrate everything from ramps to local honey to hand-crafted beers.</p>
<p>Sip your way through a food and wine festival or taste how the local food movement is taking &quot;fair food&quot; to new heights. Most of our food events also incorporate other Southern Appalachian traditions such as bluegrass music, mountain crafts and farm life demonstrations. So, put on your sneakers, grab your forks, and join the feast.</p>
<p>Food events are diverse and frequent in the Asheville area, where local Foodtopians take fine dining (and the enjoyment of creating and tasting it) seriously. From seminars on growing fine shitake mushrooms to wine tastings and cooking classes to a festival devoted to baking bread, there's always something for a foodie to do.</p>
