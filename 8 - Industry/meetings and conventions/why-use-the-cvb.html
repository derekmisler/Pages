	The Asheville CVB received our very first E2 (Exceeding Expectations) award. The award was created especially because of the special attention we received from the Asheville CVB. This award may be awarded again in the future if staff feels a CVB/hotel/community has gone far and above the expectations set for our meeting. Asheville has set the bar high!
