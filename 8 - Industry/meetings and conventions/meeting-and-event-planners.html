<blockquote>
The Asheville CVB recieved &quot;<b>our very first E2 (Exceeding Expectations) award</b>.  The award was created especially because of the special attention we received from the Asheville CVB.  This award may be awarded again in the future if staff feels a CVB/hotel/community has gone far and above the expectations set for our meeting. <b>Asheville has set the bar high</b>!&quot;
