<h4>Why/how did you select Asheville as your wedding destination?</h4>
<p>
One of the attractive traits that drew us together is our strong sense of family. Therefore, we really wanted to focus on having a relaxed, family environment for our wedding ceremony. Plus, we wanted to provide the opportunity for our families to mingle and visit a place that most had never been. Asheville was the perfect fit because of the unique environment, restaurants, outdoor activities, music venues, guided tours, chocolate factories, &nbsp;great microbreweries, and on and on! We have always loved the changing fall &nbsp;leaves and cool temperatures of Western North Carolina. The outdoor activities are limitless in that part of the world.
</p>
<h4>Describe a moment that was made extra special through Asheville as your setting?</h4>
<p>
After the ceremony, we had about an hour before the reception at Fiore&rsquo;s. Some of the wedding party went to the New French Bar to have a few drinks to celebrate before Fiore&rsquo;s. It was quite possibly my most favorite part of our wedding day. I&rsquo;ll never forget&nbsp;&nbsp; how much fun it was to have some beers with friends. We didn&rsquo;t have to coordinate a plan on where to go after Homewood, we just all agreed that we would meet at little pub near Fiore&rsquo;s. We all just gravitated to that particular pub. It was so natural.
</p>
<h4>Describe any wedding highlights that had unique or local flavor.</h4>
<p>
With the assistance of the Asheville Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau and local bakeries, we were able to make personal care packages for our guests upon &nbsp;their arrival that accentuated the unique features of the city. Our mission was to set our families loose in the city and surrounding areas so they could enjoy all the exquisite offerings. Everyone loved Biltmore Estate, the trolley tour, The Grove Park Inn, Biltmore Village, Grove Arcade, and the nightlife.

<h4>How did you select Asheville as your wedding destination?</h4>
<p>
I knew right from the start that I wanted to get married in Asheville, my hometown. We were so excited with the thought of our guests, especially those from out of town, experiencing the beauty of the Biltmore.
</p>
<h4>Where did you get married?</h4>
<p>
We chose to have our ceremony and reception at the Deerpark Restaurant on the Biltmore Estate. Traditionally, Deerpark weddings are in the courtyard, but we had our eye on the surrounding grounds. Deepark had never hosted a wedding ceremony in the field, but they were up for the challenge.
</p>
<h4>Beyond the wedding, did you or your guests enjoy the Asheville area?</h4>
<p>
My cousin Jonathan recently started up a brewery in downtown Asheville, the Craggy Mountain Brewery. Jonathan brewed a special beer for our wedding called the &ldquo;Schubrew&rdquo;, after my married name Schubert, which we served at our rehearsal and after-party. The rehearsal dinner was at the Farm Party Barn in Candler, NC with&nbsp; live music from a local bluegrass band, Brushfire Stankgrass, local 12 Bones barbeque, and the good ol&rsquo; Schubrew!

<h4>Describe a moment that was made extra special through Asheville as your setting.</h4>
<p>
Knowing that I could walk down the aisle to the Jaw&rsquo;s theme song and it would be embraced as unique, wonderful and special without ever feeling the need to be conventional. This describes Asheville to me &ndash; its ability and ease of embracing and encouraging the unique, the special, the non-conventional.
</p>
<h4>How did you pick the ceremony site?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>
Hidden River was our first stop. From the moment I stepped out of my car, the natural beauty of the area and peace of the surrounding mountains told me this is where our wedding vows were to take place, where family and friends could mingle comfortably and safely.
</p>
<h4>How did you select the food for the reception?</h4>
<p>
Laurey&rsquo;s easily won out. It was their sweet potato salad with sourwood honey that did it for us.The other major reason we chose Laurey&rsquo;s is that she&rsquo;s a huge proponent of buying local, which is a big deal to me and something I was specifically looking for. She provided us with a menu that would satisfy even the pickiest of eaters in our group and which worked within our budget beautifully.

<p>
After the wedding the younger guests went to the Bier Garden and took over most of the seating there and continued the celebration.
</p>
<h4>Describe the reception d&eacute;cor.</h4>
<p>
Coleman Place is already beautifully decorated. I designed several of my own centerpieces and the florist was able to create them for me. I chose three designs. Lots of glass containers with flowers floating in water, floating candles and candles in general. The venue is decorated fairly contemporary It was a beautiful room with the additional centerpieces.
</p>
<h4>Describe any wedding highlights that had unique or local flavor.</h4>
<p>
I gave all the hotel guests welcome bags filled with goodies to get them through the weekend. We gave guests a&nbsp; lengthy list of places to go, see, visit, shop, and dine, coupled with a list of our favorite things to see in Asheville.
