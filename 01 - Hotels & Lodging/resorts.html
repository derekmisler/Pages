<h2>Spa Heaven</h2>
<p>Asheville has all the elements that combine to make it the perfect resort vacation destination: majestic mountains, stunning views, an urban center that is surrounded by lush wooded hillsides. During the early 1920s, dignitaries and celebrities from throughout the world ventured to Asheville seeking sweet mountain air. It was a time when famous author F. Scott Fitzgerald enjoyed the luxury of the Grove Park Inn, along with presidents and other statesmen. Thomas Wolfe also came home to visit, and was received there. And the region's reputation as a health resort was well established.</p>
